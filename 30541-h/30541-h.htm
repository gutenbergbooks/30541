<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p>Agesilaus, king of Sparta, when asked what things boys
should learn, replied, &ldquo;Those which they will <i>practise</i> when
they become men.&rdquo; As health requires the observance of
the laws inherent to the different organs of the human system,
so not only boys, but girls, should acquire a knowledge of the
laws of their organization. If sound morality depends upon
the inculcation of correct principles in youth, equally so does
a sound physical system depend on a correct physical education
during the same period of life. If the teacher and
parents who are deficient in moral feelings and sentiments,
are unfit to communicate to children and youth those high
moral principles demanded by the nature of man, so are they
equally incompetent directors of the physical training of the
youthful system, if ignorant of the organic laws and the physiological
conditions upon which health and disease depend.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the study of the structure of the human
system, and the laws of the different organs, are subjects of
interest to all,&mdash;the young and the old, the learned and the
unlearned, the rich and the poor. Every scholar, and particularly
every young miss, after acquiring a knowledge of the
primary branches,&mdash;as spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic,&mdash;should
learn the structure of the human system, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
the conditions upon which health and disease depend, as this
knowledge will be required in <i>practice</i> in after life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is somewhat unaccountable,&rdquo; says Dr. Dick, &ldquo;and not
a little inconsistent, that while we direct the young to look
abroad over the surface of the earth, and survey its mountains,
rivers, seas, and continents, and guide their views to
the regions of the firmament, where they may contemplate
the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and thousands of
luminaries placed at immeasurable distances, ... that we
should never teach them <i>to look into themselves</i>; to consider
their own corporeal structures, the numerous parts of which
they are composed, the admirable functions they perform, the
wisdom and goodness displayed in their mechanism, and the
lessons of practical instruction which may be derived from
such contemplations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he says, &ldquo;One great practical end which should
always be kept in view in the study of physiology, is the
invigoration and improvement of the corporeal powers and
functions, the preservation of health, and the prevention of
disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The design of the following pages is, to diffuse in the
community, especially among the youth, a knowledge of
Human Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene. To make
the work clear and practical, the following method has
been adopted:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. The structure of the different organs of the system
has been described in a clear and concise manner. To
render this description more intelligible, one hundred and
fifty engravings have been introduced, to show the situation
of the various organs. Hence the work may be regarded
as an elementary treatise on anatomy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>2d. The functions, or uses of the several parts have been
briefly and plainly detailed; making a primary treatise on
human physiology.</p>
<p>3d. To make a knowledge of the structure and functions
of the different organs <i>practical</i>, the laws of the several
parts, and the conditions on which health depends, have
been clearly and succinctly explained. Hence it may be
called a treatise on the principles of hygiene, or health.</p>
<p>To render this department more complete, there has been
added the appropriate treatment for burns, wounds, hemorrhage
from divided arteries, the management of persons
asphyxiated from drowning, carbonic acid, or strangling,
directions for nurses, watchers, and the removal of disease,
together with an Appendix, containing antidotes for poisons,
so that persons may know what <i>should be done</i>, and what
<i>should not be done</i>, until a surgeon or physician can be
called.</p>
<p>In attempting to effect this in a brief elementary treatise
designed for schools and families, it has not been deemed
necessary to use vulgar phrases for the purpose of being
understood. The appropriate scientific term should be applied
to each organ. No more effort is required to learn the meaning
of a <i>proper</i>, than an improper term. For example: a
child will pronounce the word as readily, and obtain as
correct an idea, if you say <i>lungs</i>, as if you used the word
<i>lights</i>. A little effort on the part of teachers and parents,
would diminish the number of vulgar terms and phrases, and,
consequently, improve the language of our country. To
obviate all objections to the use of proper scientific terms, a
Glossary has been appended to the work.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>The author makes no pretensions to new discoveries in
physiological science. In preparing the anatomical department,
the able treatises of Wilson, Cruveilhier, and others
have been freely consulted. In the physiological part, the
splendid works of Carpenter, Dunglison, Liebig, and others
have been perused. In the department of hygiene many
valuable hints have been obtained from the meritorious
works of Combe, Rivers, and others.</p>
<p>We are under obligations to R. D. Mussey, M. D., formerly
Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, Dartmouth College,
N. H., now Professor of Surgery in the Ohio Medical College;
to J. E. M&rsquo;Girr, A. M., M. D., Professor of Anatomy,
Physiology, and Chemistry, St. Mary&rsquo;s University, Ill.; to
E. Hitchcock, Jr., A. M., M. D., Teacher of Chemistry and
Natural History, Williston Seminary, Mass.; to Rev. E. Hitchcock,
D. D., President of Amherst College, Mass., who examined
the revised edition of this work, and whose valuable suggestions
rendered important aid in preparing the manuscript for the
present stereotype edition.</p>
<p>We return our acknowledgments for the aid afforded by the
Principals of the several Academies and Normal Schools who
formed classes in their institutions, and examined the revised
edition as their pupils progressed, thus giving the work the
best possible test trial, namely, the recitation-room.</p>
<p>To the examination of an intelligent public, the work is
respectfully submitted by</p>
<p class='ralign'>CALVIN CUTTER.</p>

<h2>TO TEACHERS AND PARENTS.</h2>
</div>
<p>As the work is divided into chapters, the subjects of
which are complete in themselves, the pupil may commence
the study of the structure, use, and laws of the
several parts of which the human system is composed,
by selecting such chapters as fancy or utility may dictate,
without reference to their present arrangement,&mdash;as
well commence with the chapter on the digestive
organs as on the bones.</p>
<p>The acquisition of a correct pronunciation of the
technical words is of great importance, both in recitation
and in conversation. In this work, the technical
words interspersed with the text, have been divided
into syllables, and the accented syllables designated.
An ample Glossary of technical terms has also been
appended to the work, to which reference should be
made.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the subject be examined in
the form of <i>topics</i>. The questions in <i>Italics</i> are designed
for this method of recitation. The teacher
may call on a pupil of the class to describe the anatomy
of an organ from an anatomical outline plate;
afterwards call upon another to give the physiology
of the part, while a third may state the hygiene, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
which, the questions at the bottom of the page may
be asked promiscuously, and thus the detailed knowledge
of the subject possessed by the pupils will be
tested.</p>
<p>At the close of the chapters upon the Hygiene of
the several portions of the system, it is advised that
the instructor give a lecture reviewing the anatomy,
physiology, and hygiene, of the topic last considered.
This may be followed by a general examination of
the class upon the same subject. By this course a
clear and definite knowledge of the mutual relation of
the Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene, of different
parts of the human body, will be presented.</p>
<p>We also suggest the utility of the pupils&rsquo; giving
analogous illustrations, examples, and observations,
where these are interspersed in the different chapters,
not only to induce inventive thought, but to
discipline the mind.</p>
<p>To parents and others we beg leave to say, that
about two thirds of the present work is devoted to a
concise and practical description of the uses of the
important organs of the human body, and to show
how such information may be usefully applied, both
in the preservation of health, and the improvement of
physical education. To this have been added directions
for the treatment of those accidents which are
daily occurring in the community, making it a treatise
proper and profitable for the <span class='smcaplc'>FAMILY LIBRARY</span>, as well
as the school-room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>GENERAL REMARKS.</h3>
</div>
<p>1. <span class='smcap'>Anatomy</span> is the science which treats of the structure
and relations of the different parts of animals and plants.</p>
<p>2. It is divided into <i>Vegetable</i> and <i>Animal</i> anatomy. The
latter of these divisions is subdivided into <i>Human</i> anatomy,
which considers, exclusively, human beings; and <i>Comparative</i>
anatomy, which treats of the mechanism of the lower orders
of animals.</p>
<p>3. <span class='smcap'>Physiology</span> treats of the functions, or uses of the organs
of animals and plants. Another definition is, &ldquo;the science of
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. This is also divided into <i>Vegetable</i> and <i>Animal</i> physiology,
as it treats of the vegetable or animal kingdom; and
into <i>Human</i> and <i>Comparative</i> physiology, as it describes the
vital functions of man or the inferior animals.</p>
<p>5. <span class='smcap'>Hygiene</span> is the art or science of maintaining health, or
a knowledge of those laws by which health may be preserved.</p>
<p>6. The kingdom of nature is divided into <i>organic</i> and <i>inorganic</i>
bodies. Organic bodies possess organs, on whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
action depend their growth and perfection. This division
includes animals and plants. Inorganic bodies are devoid of
organs, or instruments of life. In this division are classed
the earths, metals, and other minerals.</p>
<p class='box'>1. What is anatomy? 2. How is it divided? How is the latter division
subdivided? 3. What is physiology? Give another definition. 4. How is
physiology divided? Give a subdivision. 5. What is hygiene? 6. Define
organic bodies.</p>
<p>7. In general, organic matter differs so materially from
inorganic, that the one can readily be distinguished from the
other. In the organic world, every individual of necessity
springs from some <i>parent, or immediate producing agent</i>;
for while inorganic substances are formed by chemical
laws alone, we see no case of an animal or plant coming
into existence by accident or chance, or chemical operations.</p>
<p>8. Animals and plants <i>are supported by means of nourishment</i>,
and die without it. They also increase in size <i>by the
addition of new particles of matter to all parts of their substances</i>;
while rocks and minerals grow only by additions to
their surfaces.</p>
<p>9. &ldquo;Organized bodies always present a combination of
both solids and fluids;&mdash;of solids, differing in character and
properties, arranged into organs, and these endowed with
functional powers, and so associated as to form of the whole
a single system;&mdash;and of fluids, contained in these organs,
and holding such relation to the solids that the existence,
nature, and properties of both mutually and necessarily depend
on each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10. Another characteristic is, that organic substances have
a <i>certain order of parts</i>. For example, plants possess organs
to gain nourishment from the soil and atmosphere, and the
power to give strength and increase to all their parts. And
animals need not only a digesting and circulating apparatus,
but organs for breathing, a nervous system, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='box'>6. Define inorganic bodies. 7. What is said of the difference, in general, between
organic and inorganic bodies? 8. What of the growth of organic and
inorganic bodies? 9. What do organized bodies always present? 10. Give
another characteristic of organized substances.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>11. <i>Individuality</i> is an important characteristic. For instance,
a large rock may be broken into a number of smaller
pieces, and yet every fragment will be rock; but if an organic
substance be separated into two or more divisions,
neither of them can be considered an individual. Closely
associated with this is the power of <i>life</i>, or <i>vitality</i>, which is
the most distinguishing characteristic of organic structure;
since we find nothing similar to this in the inorganic creation.</p>
<p>12. <i>The distinction between plants and animals</i> is also of
much importance. <i>Animals grow proportionally in all
directions</i>, while plants grow upwards and downwards from a
collet only. The <i>food</i> of animals is <i>organic</i>, while that of
plants is <i>inorganic</i>; the latter feeding entirely upon the elements
of the soil and atmosphere, while the former subsist
upon the products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
The size of the vegetable is in most cases limited only by the
duration of existence, as a tree continues to put forth new
branches during each period of its life, while the animal, at a
certain time of life, attains the average size of its species.</p>
<p>13. One of the most important distinctions between animals
and plants, is <i>the different effects of respiration</i>. Animals
consume the oxygen of the atmosphere, and give off
carbonic acid; while plants take up the carbonic acid, and
restore to animals the oxygen, thus affording an admirable
example of the principle of compensation in nature.</p>
<p>14. But the decisive distinctions between animals and
plants are <i>sensation</i> and <i>voluntary motion</i>, the power of acquiring
a knowledge of external objects through the senses,
and the ability to move from place to place at will. These
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
are the characteristics which, in their fullest development in
man, show intellect and reasoning powers, and thereby in a
greater degree exhibit to us the wisdom and goodness of the
Creator.</p>
<p class='box'>11. What is said of the individuality of organized and inorganized bodies?
What is closely associated with this? 12. Give a distinction between animals
and plants as regards growth. The food of animals and plants. What
is said in respect to size? 13. What important distinction in the effects of
respiration of animals and plants? 14. What are the decisive distinctions
between animals and plants?</p>
<p>15. <span class='smcap'>Disease</span>, which consists in an unnatural condition of the
bodily organs, is in most cases under the control of fixed laws,
which we are capable of understanding and obeying. Nor
do diseases come by chance; they are penalties for violating
physical laws. If we carelessly cut or bruise our flesh, pain
and soreness follow, to induce us to be more careful in the
future; or, if we take improper food into the stomach, we
are warned, perhaps immediately by a friendly pain, that we
have violated an organic law.</p>
<p>16. Sometimes, however, the penalty does not directly follow
the sin, and it requires great physiological knowledge to
be able to trace the effect to its true cause. If we possess
good constitutions, we are responsible for most of our sickness;
and bad constitutions, or hereditary diseases, are but
the results of the same great law,&mdash;the iniquities of the
parents being visited on the children. In this view of the
subject, how important is the study of physiology and hygiene!
For how can we expect to obey laws which we do not understand?</p>
<p class='box'>15. What is said of disease? 16. Why is the study of physiology and
hygiene important?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>STRUCTURE OF MAN,</h3>
</div>
<p>17. <span class='smcap'>In</span> the structure of the human body, there is a union
of fluids and solids. These are essentially the same, for the
one is readily changed into the other. There is no fluid that
does not contain solid matter in solution, and no solid matter
that is destitute of fluid.</p>
<p>18. In different individuals, and at different periods of life
the proportion of fluids and solids varies. In youth, the fluids
are more abundant than in advanced life. For this reason,
the limbs in childhood are soft and round, while in old age
they assume a hard and wrinkled appearance.</p>
<p>19. The fluids not only contain the materials from which
every part of the body is formed, but they are the medium
for conveying the waste, decayed particles of matter from the
system. They have various names, according to their nature
and function; as, the blood, and the bile.</p>
<p>20. The solids are formed from the fluids, and consequently
they are reduced, by chemical analysis, to the same ultimate
elements. The particles of matter in solids are arranged
variously; sometimes in <i>fi&acute;bres</i>, (threads,) sometimes in <i>lam&acute;i-n&aelig;</i>,
(plates,) sometimes homogeneously, as in basement membranes.
(<a href='#APPENDIX_A'>Appendix A.</a>)</p>
<p>21. The parts of the body are arranged into <i>Fi&acute;bres</i>, <i>Fas-cic&acute;u-li</i>,
<i>Tis&acute;sues</i>, <i>Or&acute;gans</i>, <i>Ap-pa-ra&acute;tus-es</i>, and <i>Sys&acute;tems</i>.</p>
<p class='box'>17. What substances enter into the structure of the human body? Are
they essentially the same? 18. What is said of these substances at different
periods of life? 19. What offices do the fluids of the system perform?
20. What is said of the solids? How are the particles of matter arranged
in solids? 21. Give an arrangement of the parts of the body.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>22. A <span class='smcaplc'>FIBRE</span> is a thread of exceeding fineness. It is either
cylindriform or flattened.</p>
<p>23. A <span class='smcaplc'>FASCICULUS</span> is the term applied to several fibres
united. Its general characteristics are the same as fibres.</p>
<p>24. A <span class='smcaplc'>TISSUE</span> is a term applied to several different solids
of the body.</p>
<p>25. An <span class='smcaplc'>ORGAN</span> is composed of tissues so arranged as to
form an instrument designed for action. The action of an
organ is called its <i>function</i>, or use.</p>
<p><i>Example.</i> The liver is an organ, and the secretion of the
bile from the blood is one of its functions.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>26. An <span class='smcaplc'>APPARATUS</span> is an assemblage of organs designed
to produce certain results.</p>
<p><i>Example.</i> The digestive apparatus consists of the <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added ','">teeth,</ins>
stomach, liver, &amp;c., all of which aid in the digestion of food.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>27. The term <span class='smcaplc'>SYSTEM</span> is applied to an assemblage of
organs arranged according to some plan, or method; as the
nervous system, the respiratory system.</p>
<p class='box'>22. Define a fibre. 23. Define a fasciculus. 24. Define a tissue. 25. Define
an organ. What is the action of an organ called? Give examples.
<i>Mention other examples.</i> 26. What is an apparatus? Give an example
27. How is the term system applied?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>28. A <span class='smcaplc'>TISSUE</span> is a simple form of organized animal substance.
It is flexible, and formed of fibres interwoven in
various ways; as, the cellular tissue.</p>
<p>29. However various all organs may appear in their structure
and composition, it is now supposed that they can be
reduced to a few tissues; as, the <i>Cel&acute;lu-lar</i>, <i>Os&acute;se-ous</i>, <i>Mus&acute;cu-lar</i>,
<i>Mu&acute;cous</i>, <i>Ner&acute;vous</i>, &amp;c. (<a href='#APPENDIX_B'>Appendix B.</a>)</p>
<p>30. The <span class='smcaplc'>CELLULAR TISSUE</span>,<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> now called the <i>areolar tissue</i>,
consists of small fibres, or bands, interlaced in every direction,
so as to form a net-work, with numerous interstices that
communicate freely with each other. These interstices are
filled, during life, with a fluid resembling the serum of blood.
The use of the areolar tissue is to connect together organs
and parts of organs, and to envelop, fix, and protect the vessels
and nerves of organs.</p>

</div>
<p class='box'>28. What is a tissue? 29. What is said respecting the structure and composition
of the various organs? Name the primary membranes. 30. Describe
the cellular tissue. How are the cells imbedded in certain tissues?
Give observation 1st, relative to the cellular tissue.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. When this fluid becomes too great in
quantity, in consequence of disease, the patient labors under
general dropsy. The swelling of the feet when standing, and
their return to a proper shape during the night, so often
noticed in feeble persons, furnish a striking proof both of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
existence and peculiarity of this tissue, which allows the
fluid to flow from cell to cell, until it settles in the lower extremities.</p>
<p>2d. The free communication between the cells is still
more remarkable in regard to air. Sometimes, when an accidental
opening has been made from the air-cells of the
lungs into the contiguous cellular tissue, the air in respiration
has penetrated every part until the whole body is so inflated
as to occasion suffocation. Butchers often avail themselves
of the knowledge of this fact, and inflate their meat to give it
a fat appearance.</p>
<p>31. &ldquo;Although this tissue enters into the composition of all
organs, it never loses its own structure, nor participates in the
functions of the organ of which it forms a part. Though
present in the nerves, it does not share in their sensibility;
and though it accompanies every muscle and every muscular
fibre, it does not partake of the irritability which belongs to
these organs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>32. Several varieties of tissue are formed from the cellular;
as, the <i>Se&acute;rous</i>, <i>Der&acute;moid</i>, <i>Fi&acute;brous</i>, and several others.</p>
<p>33. The <span class='smcaplc'>SEROUS TISSUE</span> lines all the closed, or sac-like
cavities of the body; as, the chest, joints, and abdomen. It
not only lines these cavities, but is reflected, and invests the
organs contained in them. The liver and the lungs are thus
invested. This membrane is of a whitish color, and smooth
on its free surfaces. These surfaces are kept moist, and prevented
from adhering by a <i>se&acute;rous</i> fluid, which is separated
from the blood. The use of this membrane is to separate
organs and also to facilitate the movement of one part upon
another, by means of its moist, polished surfaces.</p>
<p class='box'>Give observation 2d. 31. What is said of the identity of this tissue?
32. Name the varieties of tissue formed from the cellular. 33. Where is
the serous tissue found? What two offices does it perform? Give its
structure. What is the use of this membrane?</p>
<p>34. The <span class='smcaplc'>DERMOID TISSUE</span> covers the outside of the body.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
It is called the <i>cu&acute;tis</i>, (skin.) This membrane is continuous
with the mucous at the various orifices of the body, and in
these situations, from the similarity of their structure, it is
difficult to distinguish between them.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. In consequence of the continuity and
similarity of structure, there is close sympathy between the
mucous and dermoid membranes. If the functions of the
skin are disturbed, as by a chill, it will frequently cause a
catarrh, (cold,) or diarrh&oelig;a. Again, in consequence of this
intimate sympathy, these complaints can be relieved by exciting
a free action in the vessels of the skin.</p>
<p>2d. It is no uncommon occurrence that diseased or irritated
conditions of the mucous membrane of the stomach or
intestines produce diseases or irritations of the skin, as is seen
in the rashes attendant on dyspepsia, and eating certain species
of fish. These eruptions of the skin can be relieved by
removing the diseased condition of the stomach.</p>
<p>35. The <span class='smcaplc'>FIBROUS TISSUE</span> consists of longitudinal, parallel
fibres, which are closely united. These fibres, in some situations,
form a thin, dense, strong membrane, like that which
lines the internal surface of the skull, or invests the external
surface of the bones. In other instances, they form strong,
inelastic bands, called <i>lig&acute;a-ments</i>, which bind one bone to
another. This tissue also forms <i>ten&acute;dons</i>, (white cords,) by
which the muscles are attached to the bones.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the disease called rheumatism, the fibrous
tissue is the part principally affected; hence the joints, where
this tissue is most abundant, suffer most from this affection.</p>
<p class='box'>34. Describe the dermoid tissue. What is said of the sympathy between
the functions of the skin and mucous membrane? Give another instance
of the sympathy between these membranes. 35. Of what does the fibrous
tissue consist? How do these appear in some situations? How in others?
What tissue is generally affected in rheumatism?</p>
<p>36. The <span class='smcaplc'>ADIPOSE TISSUE</span> is so arranged as to form distinct
bags, or cells. These contain a substance called <i>fat</i>. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
tissue is principally found beneath the skin, abdominal muscles,
and around the heart and kidneys; while none is found
in the brain, eye, ear, nose, and several other organs.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In those individuals who are corpulent, there
is in many instances, a great deposit of this substance. This
tissue accumulates more readily than others when a person
becomes gross, and is earliest removed when the system
emaciates, in acute or chronic diseases. Some of the masses
become, in some instances, enlarged. These enlargements
are called <i>adipose</i>, or <i>fatty tumors</i>.</p>

<p>37. The <span class='smcaplc'>CARTILAGINOUS TISSUE</span> is firm, smooth, and highly
elastic. Except bone, it is the hardest part of the animal
frame. It tips the ends of the bones that concur in forming
a joint. Its use is to facilitate the motion of the joints by its
smooth surface, while its elastic character diminishes the
shock that would otherwise be experienced if this tissue were
inelastic.</p>
<p class='box'>36. Describe the adipose tissue. Where does this tissue principally
exist? Give observation in regard to the adipose tissue. 37. Describe the
cartilaginous tissue. What is its use?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>38 The <span class='smcaplc'>OSSEOUS TISSUE</span>, in composition and arrangement
of matter, varies at different periods of life, and in different
bones. In some instances, the bony matter is disposed in
plates, while in other instances, the arrangement is cylindrical.
Sometimes, the bony matter is dense and compact; again, it is
spongy, or porous. In the centre of the long bones, a space
is left which is filled with a fatty substance, called <i>mar&acute;row</i>.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Various opinions exist among physiologists in
regard to the use of marrow. Some suppose it serves as a
reservoir of nourishment, while others, that it keeps the bones
from becoming dry and brittle. The latter opinion, however,
has been called in question, as the bones of the aged man
contain more marrow than those of the child, and they are
likewise more brittle.</p>

</div>
<p>39. The <span class='smcaplc'>MUSCULAR TISSUE</span> is composed of many fibres,
that unite to form fasciculi, each of which is enclosed in a
delicate layer of cellular tissue. Bundles of these fasciculi
constitute a muscle.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> A piece of boiled beef will clearly illustrate
the arrangement of muscular fibre.</p>
<p class='box'>38. What is said of the osseous tissue? How is the bony matter arranged
in different parts of the animal frame? What is said of the use of marrow?

of muscular fibre be illustrated?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>40. The <span class='smcaplc'>MUCOUS TISSUE</span> differs from the serous by its
lining all the cavities which communicate with the air. The
nostrils, the mouth, and the stomach afford examples. The
external surface of this membrane, or that which is exposed
to the air, is soft, and bears some resemblance to the downy
rind of a peach. It is covered by a viscid fluid called <i>mu&acute;cus</i>.
This is secreted by small <i>gland-cells</i>, called <i>ep-i-the&acute;li-a</i>, or
secretory cells of the mucous membrane. The use of this
membrane and its secreted mucus is to protect the inner surface
of the cavities which it lines.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> A remarkable sympathy exists between the
remote parts of the mucous membrane. Thus the condition
of the stomach may be ascertained by an examination of the
tongue.</p>
<p>41. The <span class='smcaplc'>NERVOUS TISSUE</span> consists of soft, pulpy matter,
enclosed in a sheath, called <i>neu-ri-lem&acute;a</i>. This tissue consists
of two substances. The one, of a pulpy character and gray
color, is called <i>cin-e-ri&acute;tious</i>, (ash-colored.) The other, of a
fibrous character and white, is named <i>med&acute;ul-la-ry</i>, (marrow-like.)
In every part of the nervous system both substances
are united, with the exception of the nervous fibres and filaments,
which are solely composed of the medullary matter
enclosed in a delicate sheath.</p>
<p class='box'>40. How does the mucous differ from the <a name='TC_6'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'serious'">serous</ins> tissue? What is

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>CHEMISTRY OF THE HUMAN BODY.</h3>
</div>
<p>42. An <span class='smcaplc'>ULTIMATE ELEMENT</span> is the simplest form of matter
with which we are acquainted; as gold, iron, &amp;c.</p>
<p>43. These elements are divided into <i>metallic</i> and
<i>non-metallic</i> substances. The metallic substances are <i>Po-tas&acute;si-um</i>,
<i>So&acute;di-um</i>, <i>Cal&acute;ci-um</i>, <i>Mag-ne&acute;si-um</i>, <i>A-lu&acute;min-um</i>,
<i>I&acute;ron</i>, <i>Man&acute;ga-nese</i>, and <i>Cop&acute;per</i>. The non-metallic substances
are <i>Ox&acute;y-gen</i>, <i>Hy&acute;dro-gen</i>, <i>Car&acute;bon</i>, <i>Ni&acute;tro-gen</i>, <i>Si-li&acute;-ci-um</i>,
<i>Phos&acute;phor-us</i>, <i>Sul&acute;phur</i>, <i>Chlo&acute;rine</i>, and a few others.</p>
<p>44. <span class='smcap'>Potash</span> (potassium united with oxygen) is found in
the blood, bile, perspiration, milk, &amp;c.</p>
<p>45. <span class='smcap'>Soda</span> (sodium combined with oxygen) exists in the
muscles, and in the same fluids in which potash is found.</p>
<p>46. <span class='smcap'>Lime</span> (calcium combined with oxygen) forms the principal
ingredient of the bones. The lime in them is combined
with phosphoric and carbonic acid.</p>
<p>47. <span class='smcap'>Magnesia</span> (magnesium combined with oxygen) exists
in the bones, brain, and in some of the animal fluids; as milk.</p>
<p>48. <span class='smcap'>Silex</span> (silicium combined with oxygen) is contained in
the hair and in some of the secretions.</p>
<p>49. <span class='smcap'>Iron</span> forms the coloring principle of the red globules
of the blood, and is found in every part of the system.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> As metallic or mineral substances enter into
the ultimate elements of the body, the assertion that all minerals
are poisonous, however small the quantity, is untrue.</p>
<p class='box'>42. What is an ultimate element? Give examples. 43. How are they
divided? Name the metallic substances. Name the non-metallic substances.
44. What is said of potash? 45. Of soda? 46. Of lime? 47. Of magnesia?
48. Of silex? 49. What forms the coloring principle of the blood? What
is said of mineral substances?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>50. <span class='smcap'>Oxygen</span> is contained in all the fluids and solids of the
body. It is almost entirely derived from the inspired air and
water. It is expelled in the form of carbonic acid and water
from the lungs and skin. It is likewise removed in the other
secretions.</p>
<p>51. <span class='smcap'>Hydrogen</span> is found in all the fluids and in all the solids
of the body. It is derived from the food, as well as from
water and other drinks. It exists in the greatest abundance in
the impure, dark-colored blood of the system. It is removed
by the agency of the kidneys, skin, lungs, and other excretory
organs.</p>
<p>52. <span class='smcap'>Carbon</span> is an element in the oil, fat, albumen, fibrin,
gelatin, bile, and mucus. This element likewise exists in the
impure blood in the form of carbonic acid gas. Carbon is
obtained from the food, and discharged from the system by
the secretions and respiration.</p>
<p>53. <span class='smcap'>Nitrogen</span> is contained in most animal matter, but is
most abundant in fibrin. It is not contained in fat and a few
other substances.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The peculiar smell of animal matter when
burning is owing to nitrogen. This element combined with
hydrogen forms <i>am-mo&acute;ni-a</i>, (hartshorn,) when animal matter
is in a state of putrefaction.</p>
<p>54. <span class='smcap'>Phosphorus</span> is contained in many parts of the system,
but more particularly in the bones. It is generally found in
combination with oxygen, forming <i>phosphoric acid</i>. The
phosphoric acid is usually combined with alkaline bases; as
lime in the bones, forming phosphate of lime.</p>
<p>55. <span class='smcap'>Sulphur</span> exists in the bones, muscles, hair, and nails.
It is expelled from the system by the skin and intestines.</p>
<p>56. <span class='smcap'>Chlorine</span> is found in the blood, gastric juice, milk,
perspiration, and saliva.</p>
<p class='box'>50. What is said of oxygen? 51. Of hydrogen? 52. What is said of carbon?
53. Of nitrogen? How is ammonia formed? 54. What is said of
phosphorus? 55. What is said of sulphur? 56. Of chlorine?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>57. <span class='smcap'>Proximate elements</span> are forms of matter that exist
in organized bodies in abundance, and are composed chiefly
of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, arranged in different
proportions. They exist already formed, and may be
separated in many instances, by heat or mechanical means.
The most important compounds are <i>Al-bu&acute;men</i>, <a name='TC_7'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added comma"><i>Fi&acute;brin</i>,</ins>
<i>Gel&acute;a-tin</i>, <i>Mu&acute;cus</i>, <i>Fat</i>, <i>Ca&acute;se-ine</i>, <i>Chon&acute;drine</i>, <i>Lac&acute;tic acid</i>,
and <i>Os&acute;ma-zome</i>.</p>
<p>58. <span class='smcap'>Albumen</span> is found in the body, both in a fluid and solid
form. It is an element of the skin, glands, hair, and nails,
and forms the principal ingredient of the brain. Albumen is
without color, taste, or smell, and it coagulates by heat, acids,
and alcohol.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The white of an egg is composed of albumen,
which can be coagulated or hardened by alcohol. As
albumen enters so largely into the composition of the brain, is
not the impaired intellect and moral degradation of the inebriate
attributable to the effect of alcohol in hardening the albumen
of this organ?</p>
<p>59. <span class='smcap'>Fibrin</span> exists abundantly in the blood, chyle, and
lymph. It constitutes the basis of the muscles. Fibrin is
of a whitish color, inodorous, and insoluble in cold water. It
differs from albumen by possessing the property of coagulating
at all temperatures.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Fibrin may be obtained by washing the thick
part of blood with cold water; by this process, the red globules,
or coloring matter, are separated from this element.</p>
<p>60. <span class='smcap'>Gelatin</span> is found in nearly all the solids, but it is not
known to exist in any of the fluids. It forms the basis of the
cellular tissue, and exists largely in the skin, bones, ligaments,
and cartilages.</p>
<p class='box'>57. What are proximate elements? Do they exist already formed in <a name='TC_8'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'organ ized">organized</ins>
bodies? Name the most important compounds. 58. What is said of
albumen? Give observation relative to this element. 59. Of fibrin? How
does albumen differ from fibrin? How can fibrin be obtained? 60. What is
said of gelatin?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Gelatin is known from other organic principles
by its dissolving in warm water, and forming &ldquo;jelly.&rdquo; When
dry, it forms the hard, brittle substance, called <i>glue</i>. Isinglass,
which is used in the various mechanical arts, is obtained
from the sounds of the sturgeon.</p>
<p>61. <span class='smcap'>Mucus</span> is a viscid fluid secreted by the gland-cells, or
epithelia. Various substances are included under the name
of mucus. It is generally alkaline, but its true chemical
character is imperfectly understood. It serves to moisten and
defend the mucous membrane. It is found in the cuticle,
brain, and nails; and is scarcely soluble in water, especially
when dry. (<a href='#APPENDIX_C'>Appendix C.</a>)</p>
<p>62. <span class='smcap'>Osmazome</span> is a substance of an aromatic flavor. It is
of a yellowish-brown color, and is soluble both in water
and alcohol, but does not form a jelly by concentration.
It is found in all the fluids, and in some of the solids; as
the brain.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The characteristic odor and taste of soup are
owing to osmazome.</p>
<p>63. There are several acids found in the human system;
as the <i>A-ce&acute;tic</i>, <i>Ben-zo&acute;ic</i>, <i>Ox-al&acute;ic</i>, <i>U&acute;ric</i>, and some other substances,
but not of sufficient importance to require a particular
description.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE BONES.</h3>
</div>
<p>64. <span class='smcap'>The</span> bones are firm and hard, and of a dull white
color. In all the higher orders of animals, among which is
man, they are in the interior of the body, while in lobsters,
crabs, &amp;c., they are on the outside, forming a case which
protects the more delicate parts from injury.</p>
<p>65. In the mechanism of man, the variety of movements
he is called to perform requires a correspondent variety of
component parts, and the different bones of the system are
so admirably adapted to each other, that they admit of numerous
and varied motions.</p>
<p>66. When the bones composing the skeleton are united by
natural ligaments, they form what is called a <i>natural skeleton</i>,
when united by wires, what is termed an <i>artificial skeleton</i>.</p>
<p>67. The elevations, or protuberances, of the bones are
called <i>proc&acute;es-ses</i>, and are, generally, the points of attachment
for the muscles and ligaments.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE BONES.</h3>
</div>
<p>68. The <span class='smcaplc'>BONES</span> are composed of both animal and earthy
matter. The earthy portion of the bones gives them solidity
and strength, while the animal part endows them with <a name='TC_9'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">vitality.</ins></p>
<p class='box'>64. What is said of the bones? 65. Is there an adaptation of the bones
of the system to the offices they are required to perform? 66. What is a
natural skeleton? What an artificial? 67. What part of the bones are
called processes? 68&ndash;73. <i>Give the structure of the bones.</i> 68. Of what are
the bones composed? What are the different uses of the component parts
of the bones?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p><i>Experiments.</i> 1st. To show the earthy without the animal
matter, burn a bone in a clear fire for about fifteen minutes,
and it becomes white and brittle, because the gelatin, or animal
matter of the bone, has been destroyed.</p>
<p>2d. To show the animal without the earthy matter of the
bones, immerse a slender bone for a few days in a weak acid,
(one part muriatic acid and six parts water,) and it can then
be bent in any direction. In this experiment, the acid has
removed the earthy matter, (carbonate and phosphate of lime,)
yet the form of the bone is unchanged.</p>
<p>69. The bones are formed from the blood, and are subjected
to several changes before they are perfected. At their
early formative stage, they are cartilaginous. The vessels of
the cartilage, at this period, convey only the <i>lymph</i>, or white
portion of the blood; subsequently, they convey red blood.
At this time, true ossification (the deposition of phosphate and
carbonate of lime) commences at certain points, which are
called <i>the points of ossification</i>.</p>
<p>70. Most of the bones are formed of several pieces, or
centres of ossification. This is seen in the long bones which
have their extremities separated from the body by a thin
partition of cartilage. It is some time before these separate
pieces are united to form one bone.</p>
<p>71. When the process of ossification is completed, there
is still a constant change in the bones. They increase in
bulk, and become less vascular, until middle age. In advanced
life, the elevations upon their surface and near the
extremities become more prominent, particularly in individuals
accustomed to labor. As a person advances in years,
the vitality diminishes, and in extreme old age, the earthy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
substance predominates; consequently, the bones are extremely
brittle.</p>

When does true ossification commence? 70. How are most of the bones

<p>72. The fibrous membrane that invests the bones is called
<i>per-i-os&acute;te-um</i>; that which covers the cartilages is called
<i>per-i-chon&acute;dri-um</i>. When this membrane invests the skull,
it is called <i>per-i-cra&acute;ni-um</i>.</p>

<p>73. The <span class='smcaplc'>PERIOSTEUM</span> is a firm membrane immediately investing
the bones, except where they are tipped with cartilage,
and the crowns of the teeth, which are protected by enamel.
This membrane has minute nerves, and when healthy, possesses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
but little sensibility. It is the nutrient membrane of
the bone, endowing its exterior with vitality; it also gives
insertion to the tendons and connecting ligaments of the
joints.</p>
<p class='box'>72. What is the membrane called that invests the bones? That covers
the cartilage? That invests the skull? Explain fig.&nbsp;6. 73. Describe the

<p>74. There are two hundred and eight<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> bones in the human
body, beside the teeth. These, for convenience, are divided
into four parts: 1st. The bones of the <i>Head</i>. 2d. The bones
of the <i>Trunk</i>. 3d. The bones of the <i>Upper Extremities</i>.
4th. The bones of the <i>Lower Extremities</i>.</p>
<p>75. The bones of the <span class='smcaplc'>HEAD</span> are divided into those of the
<i>Skull</i>, <i>Ear</i>, and <i>Face</i>.</p>
<p>76. The <span class='smcaplc'>SKULL</span> is composed of eight bones. They are
formed of two plates, or tablets of bony matter, united by a
porous portion of bone. The external tablet is fibrous and
tough; the internal plate is dense and hard, and is called
the <i>vit&acute;re-ous</i>, or glassy table. These tough, hard plates
are adapted to resist the penetration of sharp instruments,
while the different degrees of density possessed by the two
tablets, and the intervening spongy bone, serve to diminish
the vibrations that would occur in falls or blows.</p>
<p>77. The skull is convex externally, and at the base much
thicker than at the top or sides. The most important part of
the brain is placed here, completely out of the way of injury,
unless of a very serious nature. The base of the cranium,
or skull, has many projections, depressions, and apertures;
the latter affording passages for the nerves and blood-vessels.</p>
<p class='box'>74. How many bones in the human body? How are they divided?
75&ndash;81. <i>Give the anatomy of the bones of the head.</i> 75. How are the bones

is the form of the skull? What does the base of the skull present?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>78. The bones of the cranium are united by ragged
edges, called <i>sut&acute;ures</i>. The edges of each bone interlock
with each other, producing a union, styled, in carpentry, <i>dovetailing</i>.
They interrupt, in a measure, the vibrations produced
by external blows, and also prevent fractures from
extending as far as they otherwise would, in one continued
bone. From infancy to the twelfth year, the sutures are
imperfect; but, from that time to thirty-five or forty, they are
distinctly marked; in old age, they are nearly obliterated.</p>

<p>79. We find as great a diversity in the form and texture
of the skull-bone, as in the expression of the face. The head
of the New Hollander is small; that of the African is compressed;
while the Caucasian is distinguished for the beautiful
oval form of the head. The Greek skulls, in texture, are
close and fine, while the Swiss are softer and more open.</p>

in the <i>Pel&acute;vis</i>; the <i>Ster&acute;num</i>, (breast-bone;) and the <i>Os hy-oid&acute;es</i>,

</div>
<p>84. The <span class='smcaplc'>STERNUM</span> is composed of eight pieces in the child.
These unite and form but three parts in the adult. In youth,
the two upper portions are converted into bone, while the
lower portion remains cartilaginous and flexible until extreme
old age, when it is often converted into bone.</p>
<p>85. The <span class='smcaplc'>RIBS</span> are connected with the spinal column, and increase
in length as far as the seventh. From this they successively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
become shorter. The direction of the ribs from above,
downward, is oblique, and their curve diminishes from the first
to the twelfth. The external surface of each rib is convex; the
internal, concave. The inferior, or lower ribs, are, however,
very flat.</p>
<p class='box'>83. Describe the thorax. Explain fig.&nbsp;9. 84. Describe the <a name='TC_12'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">sternum.</ins>
85. Describe the ribs.</p>
<p>86. The seven upper ribs are united to the sternum,
through the medium of cartilages, and are called the <i>true ribs</i>.
The cartilages of the next three are united with each other,
and are not attached to the sternum; these are called <i>false
ribs</i>. The lowest two are called <i>floating ribs</i>, as they are not
connected either with the sternum or the other ribs.</p>
<p>87. The <span class='smcaplc'>SPINAL COLUMN</span> is composed of twenty-four pieces
of bone. Each piece is called a <i>vert&acute;e-bra</i>. On examining
one of the bones, we find seven projections, called <i>processes</i>;
four of these, that are employed in binding the bones together,
are called <i>articulating</i> processes; two of the remaining are
called the <i>transverse</i>; and the other, the <i>spinous</i>. The last
three give attachment to the muscles of the back.</p>
<p>88. The large part of the vertebra, called the body, is
round and spongy in its texture, like the extremity of the
round bones. The processes are of a more dense character.
The projections are so arranged that a tube, or canal, is formed
immediately behind the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;, in which is
placed the <i>me-dul&acute;la spi-na&acute;lis</i>, (spinal cord,) sometimes
called the pith of the back-bone.</p>
<p>89. Between these joints, or vertebr&aelig;, is a peculiar and
highly elastic substance, which much facilitates the bending
movements of the back. This compressible cushion of cartilage
also serves the important purpose of diffusing and
diminishing the shock in walking, running, or leaping, and
tends to protect the delicate texture of the brain.</p>
<p class='box'>86. How are the ribs united to the sternum? 87. Describe the spinal
column. 88. Give the structure of the vertebra. Where is the spinal
cord placed? 89. What is placed between each <a name='TC_13'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '?'">vertebra?</ins> What is
its use?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>90. Another provision for the protection of the brain,
which bears convincing proof of the wisdom and beneficence
of the Creator, is the antero-posterior, or forward and backward
curve of the spinal column. Were it a straight column,
standing perpendicularly, the slightest jar, in walking, would
cause it to recoil with a sudden jerk; because, the weight
bearing equally, the spine would neither yield to the one side
nor the other. But, shaped as it is, we find it yielding in the
direction of the curves, and thus the force of the shock is
diffused.</p>

<p><i>Observation.</i> A good idea of the structure of the vertebr&aelig;
may be obtained by examining the spinal column of a
domestic animal, as the dog, cat, or pig.</p>
<p>91. The <span class='smcaplc'>PELVIS</span> is composed of four bones; the two <i>in-nom-i-na&acute;ta</i>,
(nameless bones,) the <i>sa&acute;crum</i>, and the <i>coc&acute;cyx</i>.</p>
<p>92. The <span class='smcaplc'>INNOMINATUM</span>, in the child, consists of three pieces.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
These, in the adult, become united, and constitute but one

<p>95. <span class='smcap'>The</span> bones of the upper and lower limbs are enlarged
at each extremity, and have projections, or processes. To
these, the tendons of muscles and ligaments are attached,
which connect one bone with another. The shaft of these
bones is cylindrical and hollow, and in structure, their exterior
surface is hard and compact, while the interior portion is
of a reticulated character. The enlarged extremities of the
round bones are more porous than the main shaft.</p>
<p>96. The <span class='smcaplc'>UPPER EXTREMITIES</span> contain sixty-four bones&mdash;the
<i>Scap&acute;u-la</i>, (shoulder-blade;) the <i>Clav&acute;i-cle</i>, (collar-bone;)
the <i>Hu&acute;mer-us</i>, (first bone of the arm;) the <i>Ul&acute;na</i> and <i>Ra&acute;di-us</i>,

<p>97. The <span class='smcaplc'>CLAVICLE</span> is attached, at one extremity, to the
sternum; at the other, it is united to the scapula. It is shaped
like the Italic <i>&#x222b;</i>. Its use is to keep the arms from sliding
toward the breast.</p>
<p>98. The <span class='smcaplc'>SCAPULA</span> is situated upon the upper and back part
of the chest. It is flat, thin, and of a triangular form. This
bone lies upon and is retained in its position by muscles. By
their contractions it may be moved in different directions.</p>
<p>99. The <span class='smcaplc'>HUMERUS</span> is cylindrical, and is joined at the elbow
with the ulna of the fore-arm; at the scapular extremity, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
lodged in the <i>glenoid</i> cavity, where it is surrounded by a

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BONES.</h3>
</div>
<p>119. <span class='smcap'>The</span> bones are the framework of the system. By
their solidity and form, they not only retain every part of the
fabric in its proper shape, but afford a firm surface for the
attachment of the muscles and ligaments. By means of the
bones, the human frame presents to the eye a wonderful
piece of mechanism, uniting the most finished symmetry of
form with freedom of motion, and also giving security to
many important organs.</p>
<p>120. To give a clear idea of the relative uses of the bones
and muscles, we will quote the comparison of another, though,
as in other comparisons, there are points of difference. The
&ldquo;bones are to the body what the masts and spars are to the
ship,&mdash;they give support and the power of resistance. The
muscles are to the bones what the ropes are to the masts and
spars. The bones are the levers of the system; by the
action of the muscles their relative positions are changed. As
the masts and spars of a vessel must be sufficiently firm to
sustain the action of the ropes, so the bones must possess the
same quality to sustain the action of the muscles in the
human body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>121. Some of the bones are designed exclusively for the
protection of the organs which they enclose. Of this number
are those that form the skull, the sockets of the eye, and the
cavity of the nose. Others, in addition to the protection they
give to important organs, are useful in movements of certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
kinds. Of this class are the bones of the spinal column, and
ribs. Others are subservient to motion. Of this class are the
upper and lower extremities.</p>
<p class='box'>119&ndash;128. <i>Give the physiology of the bones.</i> 119. How may the bones be
considered? 120. To what may the bones be compared? 121. Give the
different offices of the bones.</p>
<p>122. The bones are subject to growth and decay; to removal
of old, useless matter, and the deposit of new particles,
as in other tissues. This has been tested by the following
experiment. Some of the inferior animals were fed with food
that contained madder. In a few days, some of the animals
were killed, and their bones exhibited an unusually reddish
appearance. The remainder of the animals were, for a few
weeks, fed on food that contained no coloring principle.
When they were killed, their bones exhibited the usual color
of such animals. The coloring matter, which had been deposited,
had been removed by the action of the lymphatics.</p>
<p>123. The extremities of the bones that concur in forming
a joint, correspond by having their respective configurations
reciprocal. They are, in general, the one convex, and the
other concave. In texture they are porous, and consequently
more elastic than if more compact. These are covered
with a cushion of cartilage. The elastic character of these
parts acts as so many springs, in diminishing the jar which
important organs of the system would otherwise receive.</p>
<p>124. The synovial membrane secretes a viscous fluid,
which is called <i>syn-o&acute;vi-a</i>. This lubricating fluid of the joints
enables the surfaces of the bones and tendons to move smoothly
upon each other, thus diminishing the friction consequent
on their action.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. In this secretion is manifested the skill
and omnipotence of the Great Architect; for no machine of
human invention supplies to itself, by its own operations, the
necessary lubricating fluid. But, in the animal frame, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
supplied in proper quantities, and applied in the proper place,
and at the proper time.</p>
<p class='box'>122. What is said of the change in bones? How was it proved that
there was a constant change in the osseous fabric? 123. What is said of
the extremities of the bones that form a joint? 124. What is synovia? Its
use? What is said of this lubricating fluid?</p>
<p>2d. In some cases of injury and disease, the synovial fluid
is secreted in large quantities, and distends the sac of the
joint. This affection is called dropsy of the joint, and occurs
most frequently in that of the knee.</p>
<p>125. The function of the ligaments is to connect and bind
together the bones of the system. By them the small bones
of the wrist and foot, as well as the large bones, are as securely
fastened as if retained by clasps of steel. Some of
them are situated within the joints, like a central cord, or
pivot, (3, fig.&nbsp;26.) Some surround it like a hood, and contain
the lubricating synovial fluid, (8, 9, fig.&nbsp;25,) and some in
the form of bands at the side, (5, 6, fig.&nbsp;23.)</p>

length of the spinal column, in powerful bands, on the outer
surface, between the spinal bones, and from one spinous process
to another. They bind the ribs to the vertebr&aelig;, to the transverse
process behind, and to the sternum in front; and this
to the clavicle; and this to the first rib and scapula; and this
last to the humerus.</p>
<p class='box'>What is the effect when the synovial fluid is secreted in large quantities?
125. What is the function of the ligaments? 126. Mention how the
bones of the system are connected.</p>
<p>127. They also bind the two bones of the fore-arm at the
elbow-joint; and these to the wrist; and these to each other
and to those of the hand; and these last to each other and
to those of the fingers and thumb. In the same manner, they
bind the bones of the pelvis together; and these to the femur;
and this to the two bones of the leg and patella; and so on, to
the ankle, foot, and toes, as in the upper extremities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE BONES.</h3>
</div>
<p>129. <i>The bones increase in size and strength by use, while
they are weakened by inaction.</i> Exercise favors the deposition
of both animal and earthy matter, by increasing the
circulation and nutrition in this texture. For this reason, the
bones of the laborer are dense and strong, while those who
neglect exercise, or are unaccustomed to manual employment,
are deficient in size, and have not a due proportion of earthy
matter to give them the solidity and strength of the laboring
man.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The tendons of the muscles are attached
near the extremities of the bones. Exercise of the muscles
increases the action of the vessels of that part to which the
tendons are attached, and thus increases the nutrition and size
of this portion of the bone. Hence the joints of an industrious
mechanic or farmer are larger than those of an individual
who has not pursued manual vocations.</p>
<p>130. <i>The gelatinous bones of the child are not so well
adapted for labor and severe exercise as those of an adult.</i>
1st. They are liable to become distorted. 2d. They are consolidated
by the deposition of earthy material before they are
fully and properly developed. If a young animal, as the
colt, be put to severe, continued labor, the deposition of earthy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
matter is hastened, and the bones are consolidated before
they attain full growth. Such colts make small and inferior
animals. Similar results follow, if a youth is compelled to
toil unduly before maturity of growth is attained. On the
other hand, moderate and regular labor favors a healthy
development and consolidation of the bones.</p>
<p class='box'>129&ndash;148. <i>Give the hygiene of the bones.</i> 129. What effect has exercise
upon the bones? What effect has inaction? Why are the joints of the
industrious farmer and mechanic larger than those of a person unaccustomed
to manual employment? 130. Give the first reason why the
bones of the child are not adapted to severe exercise. The second
reason.</p>
<p>131. <i>The kind and amount of labor should be adapted to the
age, health, and development of the bones.</i> Neither the flexible
bones of the child nor the brittle bones of the aged man
are adapted, by their organization, to long-continued, and hard
labor. Those of the one bend too easily, while those of the
other fracture too readily. In middle age, the proportions of
animal and earthy matter are, usually, such as to give the
proper degree of flexibility, firmness, and strength for labor,
with little liability to injury.</p>
<p>132. <i>The imperfectly developed bones of the young child
will not bear long-continued exertions or positions without
injury.</i> Hence the requisitions of the rigid disciplinarian of
schools, are unwise when he compels his pupils to remain in
one position for a long time. He may have a &ldquo;quiet school;&rdquo;
but, not unfrequently, by such discipline, the constitution is
impaired, and permanent injury is done to the pupils.</p>
<p>133. <i>The lower extremities, in early life, contain but a small
proportion of earthy matter</i>; they bend when the weight of
the body is thrown upon them for a long time. Hence, the
assiduous attempts to induce children to stand or walk, either
naturally or artificially, when very young, are ill advised,
and often productive of serious and permanent evil. The
&ldquo;bandy&rdquo; or bow legs are thus produced.</p>
<p class='box'>What effect has moderate, regular labor upon the growing youth?
131. What remark respecting the kind and amount of labor? At what age
are the bones best fitted for labor? 132. What effect has long-continued
exertions or positions on the bones of a child? What is said of the requisitions
of some teachers, who have the famed &ldquo;quiet schools&rdquo;? 133. Why
should not the child be induced to stand or walk, either naturally or artificially,
at too early an age?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>134. <i>The benches or chairs for children in a school-room
should be of such a height as to permit the feet to rest on the floor.</i>
If the bench is so high as not to permit the feet to rest upon
the floor, the weight of the limbs below the knee may cause
the flexible bone of the thigh to become curved. The child
thus seated, is inclined to lean forward, contracting an injurious
and ungraceful habit. Again, when the feet are not supported,
the child soon becomes exhausted, restless, and unfit
for study. In the construction of a school-room, the benches
should be of different heights, so as to be adapted to the different
pupils, and they should also have appropriate backs.</p>

<p>135. <i>Compression of the chest should be avoided.</i> In children,
and also in adults, the ribs are very flexible, and a small
amount of pressure will increase their curvature, particularly at
the lower part of the chest, and thus lessen the size of this
cavity. The lower ribs are united to the breast-bone, by long,
yielding cartilages, and compression may not only contract
the chest, but an unseemly and painful ridge may be produced,
by the bending of the cartilages, on one or both sides
of the sternum.</p>

<p>136. Again, the cartilages on one side may be bent outward,
while those on the opposite side are bent inward, thus
forming a depression parallel with the sternum. In some instances,
the anterior extremity of the lower ribs on each side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
are brought nearly or quite together. In these instances, the
movable extremities of the ribs are drawn down toward the
haunch-bones, while the space between the ribs is lessened.
All this may be effected by tight or &ldquo;snug&rdquo; clothing. Therefore
the apparel of a child should be loose, and supported
over the shoulders, to avoid the before-mentioned evils. The
same may be said of the clothing for adults.</p>
<p>137. <i>The erect position in sitting and standing should be
assiduously observed.</i> The spinal column, in its natural position,
curves from front to back, but not from side to side
The admirable arrangement of the bones, alternating with cartilages,
permits a great variety of motions and positions; and
when the spine is inclined to either side, the elasticity of its
cartilages tends to restore it to its natural position. For this
reason we may incline the spinal column in any direction for

the erect position is assumed.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>138. But if a stooping position, or a lateral curved posture,
is continued for a long time, the spinal column does not easily
recover its proper position, for the compressed edges of the
cartilages lose their power of reaction, and finally one side of
the cartilage becomes thinned, while the other is thickened;
and these wedge-shaped cartilages produce a permanent curvature
of the spinal column. In a similar way, the student,
seamstress, artisan, and mechanic acquire a stooping position,
and become round shouldered, by inclining forward to bring
their books or work nearer the eyes.</p>
<p class='box'>136. May simply &ldquo;snug&rdquo; clothing compress the cartilages? How should
the apparel of a child be worn? 137. In what direction does the spinal
column, in its natural position, curve? What restores it to its natural
position when curved laterally? 138. What is the effect if a lateral curved
position of the spinal column is continued for a long time? 139. When
one shoulder is elevated for a long time, what is the effect upon the
spinal column?</p>
<p>139. Pupils, while writing, drawing, and sometimes while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
studying, frequently incline the spinal column to one side, in
order to accommodate themselves to the desks at which they
are seated. Often, these are higher than the elbow as it hangs
from the shoulder while at rest. This attitude elevates one
shoulder while it depresses the other; consequently, the upper
part of the spinal column is inclined toward the elevated
shoulder, and the lower part is curved in the opposite direction,
giving the form of the letter <i>S</i> to the supporting column
of the body.</p>

too long, or if the opposite shoulder is elevated for the

than the left. This arises from the greater use of the

the oblique positions assumed in performing the daily vocations
of life. With proper care, and by calling into action

Fig. 35. A representation of a deformed trunk.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>141. The loss of symmetry and diminution of height from
deformed spines are minor considerations, compared with the
distortions that the chest experiences, thereby impairing respiration
and inducing diseases of the heart and lungs. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
invasion of the functions of these two important organs lessens
the vitality of the whole system, and causes general ill health.
Again, the curvature of the spinal column is frequently attended
by irritation and disease of the spinal cord.</p>
<p class='box'>Why does the right shoulder project more frequently than the left? How
can this deformity be prevented? 141. What is said of deformed spinal
columns?</p>
<p>142. Eminent physicians, both in this country and France
state that not more than one female in ten, who has been fashionably
educated, is free from deformities of the shoulder or
spinal column. Teachers, as well as mothers, should notice
the positions of the child in performing the tasks allotted to
it, whether studying or pursuing any employment. The feebler
the organization of the child, the more frequently should
there be a change of position.</p>
<p>143. When a slight projection of the shoulder, with a curvature
of the spine, exists, it can be improved by walking with
a book, or something heavier, upon the head; to balance which,
the spinal column must be nearly erect. Those people that
carry burdens upon their heads seldom have crooked spines.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Persons from the North, in travelling through
the Southern States, are surprised to see the heavy burdens
that the porters carry on their heads. It is not unusual to see
them walking at a rapid pace, with one or two trunks, weighing
fifty or eighty pounds each, upon their heads. Occasionally,
we meet an itinerant toy-man, with his tray of fragile
merchandise upon his head, walking with as much apparent
security, as though his toys, or images, were in his hands.
This is the easiest method of carrying burdens, because the
position of the head and spinal column is erect.</p>
<p>144. <i>If the animal and earthy matter of the bones is not
deposited in proper proportions, they are deficient in strength.</i>
If the gelatin predominates, the bones are weak, and become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
distorted. When nutrition is defective in the cylindrical
bones, the heads are generally enlarged, and the shafts
crooked; if in the spinal column, it may be curved; or in the
cranium, it may be enlarged. This disease is familiarly known
by the name of rickets. It is most common among these who
have poor and insufficient food, live in dark, damp rooms, and
breathe a vitiated air. The prevention and remedies for this
disease are cleanliness, regular exercise, pure air, and nutritious
food.</p>
<p class='box'>142. What statement by eminent physicians respecting deformities of the
spine? What caution to teachers and mothers? 143. Why should we
stand and sit erect? How may slight deformities of the spine be prevented?
What is frequently noticed in travelling South? 144. What is
the effect upon the bones when the gelatin preponderates?</p>
<p>145. When a bone is broken, some days elapse before the
substance that reunites it is thrown out from the blood. In
young persons, it may be secreted during the second or third
week, and in individuals advanced in life, usually during the
third and fourth week. When the bone is uniting, during the
second, third, or fourth week, the attention of a surgeon is
more needed than during the first week. At this time, the
ends of the bone should be placed together with accuracy,
which requires the careful application of proper dressing.
After the bones have united, it will take some weeks to
consolidate the uniting material and render the &ldquo;callus,&rdquo; or
union, firm. During this time, the limb should be used with
care.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When a bone is fractured, a surgeon is immediately
called, and the bone is &ldquo;set.&rdquo; While the limb remains
swelled and painful, the surgeon is required to attend and
keep the dressings (bandages and splints) on. When the
swelling has abated, and the pain subsided, frequently the
patient intimates to the surgeon that his services can be
dispensed with, as the &ldquo;limb is doing well.&rdquo; This is the most
important period, as the bone is uniting, and, unless the ends
are nicely adjusted, the dressing properly applied, the person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
will find, on recovery, a shortened and crooked limb. The
surgeon is then censured, when he is not blamable.</p>
<p class='box'>What is one cause of rickets? What are the prevention and remedies
for this disease? 145. Does the time vary when the reuniting substance
of the bone is secreted from the blood? When is the surgeon&rsquo;s care most
needed? Why?</p>
<p>146. It is seldom that a bone is displaced without injury
to the connecting ligaments and membranes. When these
connecting bands are lacerated, pain, swelling, and other
symptoms indicating inflammation succeed, which should be
removed by proper treatment, directed by a surgical adviser.</p>
<p>147. In sprains, but few, if any, of the fibres of the connecting
ligaments are lacerated; but they are unduly strained
and twisted, which occasions acute pain at the time of the
injury. This is followed by inflammation and weakness of the
joints. The treatment of these injuries is similar to that of a
dislocated bone after its reduction. The most important item
in the treatment during the few first days, is rest.</p>
<p>148. In persons of scrofulous constitutions, and those in
whom the system is enfeebled by disease, white swellings and
other chronic diseases of the joints frequently succeed sprains.
Such persons cannot be too assiduous in adopting a proper and
early treatment of injured joints.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE MUSCLES.</h3>
</div>
<p>149. <span class='smcap'>All</span> the great motions of the body are caused by the
movement of some of the bones which form the framework
of the system; but these, independently of themselves, have
not the power of motion, and only change their position
through the action of other organs attached to them, which, by
contracting, draw the bones after them. In some of the slight
movements, as the winking of the eye, no bones are displaced.
These moving, contracting organs are the <i>Mus&acute;cles</i>, (lean
meat.)</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE MUSCLES.</h3>
</div>
<p>150. The <span class='smcaplc'>MUSCLES</span>, by their size and number, constitute the
great bulk of the body, upon which they bestow form and
symmetry. In the limbs, they are situated around the bones,
which they invest and defend, while they form, to some of the
joints, their principal protection. In the trunk, they are spread
out to enclose cavities, and constitute a defensive wall, capable
of yielding to internal pressure, and reassuming its original
state.</p>
<p>151. In structure, a muscle is composed of <i>fas-cic&acute;u-li</i>
(bundles of fibres) of variable size. These are enclosed in a
cellular membranous investment, or sheath. Every bundle
composed of a number of small fibres, and each fibre consists
of a number of filaments, each of which is enclosed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
a delicate sheath. Toward the extremity of the organ the
muscular fibre ceases, and the cellular structure becomes
aggregated, and so modified as to constitute <i>ten&acute;dons</i>, (cords,)
by which the muscle is tied to the surface of the bone. The
union is so firm, that, under extreme violence, the bone will
sooner break than permit the tendon to separate from its
attachment. In some situations, there is an expansion of the
tendon, in the manner of a membrane, called <i>Ap-o-neu-ro&acute;sis</i>,
or <i>Fas&acute;ci-a</i>.</p>
<p class='box'>149. How are all the motions of the body produced? What are these
motor organs called? 150&ndash;160. <i>Give the anatomy of the <a name='TC_28'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">muscles.</ins></i>

<p>152. Muscles present various modifications in the arrangement
of their fibres, as relates to their tendinous structure.
Sometimes they are completely longitudinal, and terminate, at
each extremity, in a tendon, the entire muscle being spindle-shaped.
In other situations, they are disposed like the rays of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
a fan, converging to a tendinous point, and constituting a
<i>ra&acute;di-ate</i> muscle. Again they are <i>pen&acute;ni-form</i>, converging,
like the plumes of a pen, to one side of a tendon, which runs
the whole length of the muscle; or they are <i>bi-pen&acute;ni-form</i>,
converging to both sides of the tendon.</p>
<p class='box'>How are tendons or cords formed? What is the expansion of a tendon
called? How can the structure of muscles and their fibres be shown?
What does fig.&nbsp;36 represent? 152. Give the different arrangements of
muscular fibres.</p>
<p>153. In the description of a muscle, its attachments are
expressed by the terms &ldquo;origin&rdquo; and &ldquo;insertion.&rdquo; The
term <i>origin</i> is generally applied to the more fixed or central
attachment, or to the point toward which motion is directed;
while <i>insertion</i> is assigned to the more movable point, or to
that most distant from the centre. The middle, fleshy portion
is called the &ldquo;belly,&rdquo; or &ldquo;swell.&rdquo; The color of a muscle
is red in warm-blooded fish and animals; and each fibre is
supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics, and both sensitive
and motor nervous filaments.</p>
<p>154. The <span class='smcaplc'>FASCIA</span> is of various extent and thickness, distributed
through the different regions of the body, for the purpose
of investing and protecting the softer and more delicate
organs. An instance is seen in the membrane which envelopes
a leg of beef, and which is observed on the edges of
the slices when it is cut for broiling. When freshly exposed,
it is brilliant in appearance, tough, and inelastic. In the limbs
it forms distinct sheaths to all the muscles.</p>
<p>155. This tendinous membrane assists the muscles in their
action, by keeping up a tonic pressure on their surface. It
aids materially in the circulation of the fluids, in opposition
to the laws of gravity. In the palm of the hand and sole of
the foot, it is a powerful protection to the structures that enter
into the formation of these parts. In all parts of the system,
the separate muscles are not only invested by fascia, but they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
are arranged in layers, one over another. The sheath of each
muscle is loosely connected with another, by the cellular
membrane.</p>
<p class='box'>153. What is meant by the origin of a muscle? The insertion? The
swell? What is the color of muscles? With what is each muscular fibre
supplied? 154. What is said of fascia? What is its appearance when
freshly exposed? 155. What effect has it on the muscles? Give other
uses of the fascia.</p>
<p>156. The interstices between the different muscles are
filled with adipose matter, or fat. This is sometimes called
the packing of the system. To the presence of this tissue,
youth are indebted for the roundness and beauty of their
limbs.</p>

<p><i>Observation.</i> When we are sick, and cannot take food,
the body is sustained by absorption of the fat. The removal
of it into the blood causes the sunken cheek, hollow eye, and
prominent appearance of the bones after a severe illness.</p>
<p>158. The number of muscles in the human body is more
than five hundred; in general, they form about the skeleton
two layers, and are distinguished into superficial and deep-seated
muscles. Some of the muscles are voluntary in their
motions, or act under the government of the will, as those
which move the fingers, limbs, and trunk; while others are
involuntary, or act under the impression of their proper stimulants,
without the control of the individual, as the heart.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The abdominal muscles are expiratory,
and the chief agents for expelling the residuum from the rectum,
the bile from the gall bladder, the contents of the stomach
and bowels when vomiting, and the mucus and irritating substances
from the bronchial tubes, trachea, and nasal passages
by coughing and sneezing. To produce these effects they all
act together. Their violent and continued action sometimes
produces hernia, and, when spasmodic, may occasion ruptures
of the different organs.</p>
<p>2d. The contraction and relaxation of the abdominal muscles
and diaphragm stimulate the stomach, liver, and intestines
to a healthy action, and are subservient to the digestive powers.
If the contractility of their muscular fibres is destroyed or
impaired, the tone of the digestive apparatus will be diminished,
as in indigestion and costiveness. This is frequently attended
by a displacement of those organs, as they generally gravitate
towards the lower portion of the abdominal cavity, when the
sustaining muscles lose their tone and become relaxed.</p>

between the thorax and the abdomen. It is penetrated by the
&oelig;sophagus on its way to the stomach, by the aorta conveying
blood toward the lower extremity, and by the ascending vena
cava, or vein, on its way to the heart.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MUSCLES.</h3>
</div>
<p>161. <span class='smcap'>The</span> muscles exercise great influence upon the system.
It is by their contraction that we are enabled to pursue
different employments. By their action the farmer cultivates
his fields, the mechanic wields his tools, the sportsman pursues
his game, the orator gives utterance to his thoughts, the lady
sweeps the keys of the piano, and the young are whirled in
the mazy dance. As the muscles bear so intimate a relation
to the pleasures and employments of man, a knowledge of
the laws by which their action is governed, and the conditions
upon which their health depends, should be possessed by all.</p>
<p>162. The peculiar characteristic of muscular fibres is
<i>contractility</i>, or the power of shortening their substance on
the application of stimuli, and again relaxing when the stimulus
is withdrawn. This is illustrated in the most common
movements of life. Call into action the muscles that elevate
the arm, by the influence of the <i>will</i>, or mind, (the common
stimulus of the muscles,) and the hand and arm are raised;
withdraw this influence by a simple effort of the will, and the
muscles, before rigid and tense, become relaxed and yielding.</p>
<p>163. The contractile effect of the muscles, in producing the
varied movements of the system, may be seen in the bending
of the elbow. The tendon of one extremity of the muscle is
attached to the shoulder-bone, which acts as a fixed point; the
tendon of the other extremity is attached to one of the bones
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
of the fore-arm. When the swell of the muscle contracts, or
shortens, its two extremities approach nearer each other, and
by the approximation of the terminal extremities of the muscle,
the joint at the elbow bends. On this principle, all the
joints of the system are moved. This is illustrated by fig.&nbsp;45.</p>
<p class='box'>161&ndash;172. <i>Give the physiology of the muscles.</i> 161. What are some of the
influences exerted by the muscles on the system? 162. What is peculiar
to muscular fibres? How is this illustrated? 163. Explain how the movements
of the system are effected by the contraction of the muscles.</p>

Fig. 45. A representation of the manner in which all of the joints of the body are moved. 1, The bone of the arm above the elbow. 2, One of the bones below the elbow. 3, The muscle that bends the elbow. This muscle is united, by a tendon, to the bone below the elbow, (4,) at the other extremity, to the bone above the elbow, (5,) 6, The muscle that extends the elbow. 7, Its attachment to the point of the elbow. 8, A weight in the hand to be raised. The central part of the muscle 3 contracts, and its two ends are brought nearer together. The bones below the elbow are brought to the lines shown by 9, 10, 11. The weight is raised in the direction of the curved line. When the muscle 6 contracts, the muscle 3 relaxes and the fore-arm is extended.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><i>Experiments.</i> 1st. Clasp the arm midway between the
shoulder and elbow, with the thumb and fingers of the
opposite hand. When the arm is bent, the inside muscle
will become hard and prominent, and its tendon at the elbow
rigid, while the muscle on the opposite side will become
flaccid. Extend the arm at the elbow, and the outside muscle
will swell and become firm, while the inside muscle and its
tendon at the elbow will be relaxed.</p>
<p class='box'>Explain fig.&nbsp;45. Give experiment 1st.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>2d. Clasp the fore-arm about three inches below the
elbow, then open and shut the fingers rapidly, and the swelling
and relaxation of the muscles on the opposite sides of the
arms, alternating with each other, will be felt, corresponding
with the movement of the fingers. While the fingers are
bending, the inside muscles swell, and the outside ones become
flaccid; and, while the fingers are extending, the inside
muscles relax, and the outside ones swell. The alternate
swelling and relaxation of antagonist muscles may be felt in
the different movements of the limbs.</p>
<p>164. Each fibre of the several muscles receives from the
brain, through the nervous filament appropriated to it, a certain
influence, called nervous fluid, or stimulus. It is this that
induces contraction, while the suspension of this stimulus
causes relaxation of the fibres. By this arrangement, the
action of the muscular system, both as regards duration and
power, is, to a limited extent, under the control of the mind.
The more perfect the control, the better the education of the
muscular system; as is seen in the graceful, effective, and
well-educated movements of musicians, dancers, skaters, &amp;c.</p>
<p>165. The length of time which a muscle may remain contracted,
varies. The duration of the contraction of the voluntary
muscles, in some measure, is in an inverse ratio to its
force. If a muscle has contracted with violence, as when
great effort is made to raise a heavy weight, relaxation will
follow sooner than when the contraction has been less powerful,
as in raising light bodies.</p>
<p>166. The velocity of the muscular contraction depends on
the will. Many of the voluntary muscles in man contract
with great rapidity, so that he is enabled to utter distinctly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
fifteen hundred letters in a minute; the pronunciation of each
letter requiring both relaxation and contraction of the same
muscle, thus making three thousand actions in one minute.
But the contraction of the muscles of some of the inferior
animals surpasses in rapidity those of man. The race-horse,
it is said, has run a mile in a minute; and many birds of prey
will probably pass not less than a thousand miles daily.</p>
<p class='box'>Give experiment 2d. 164. With what is each muscular fibre supplied?
What effect has this stimulus on the muscles? 165. how long does a voluntary
muscle remain contracted? 166. On what is the velocity of muscular
contraction dependent? How many letters may be pronounced in a
minute?</p>
<p>167. The functions of the involuntary muscles are necessary
the digestion of food, the absorption and circulation of
the nutritive fluids. They could not be trusted with safety to
the control of the will, lest the passions or the indiscretions of
the person should continually avert those operations so necessary
to health, and even to life. The Divine Builder of this
complicated machine has wisely ordered that the muscles
upon which these motions depend, shall act under the impression
of their proper stimulants, without the control of the
individual.</p>
<p>168. Again, there are certain operations which could not
be safely intrusted to the absolute government of the voluntary
muscles, or entirely removed from their control. Thus life
can be supported only a few minutes without breathing; but
it would be impossible to perform the daily vocations of life
if we were compelled to breathe at all times, or at perfectly
regular intervals.</p>
<p>169. It has been observed that, among men of the same
size, a wide difference exists in their strength and activity&mdash;qualities
which depend upon the size and number of the
nerves, the size and activity of the brain, and the education,
or training of the muscles. Men having large nerves leading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
to the muscles, with the brain active, and muscles well trained
will perform feats of strength and agility, that other men, of
the same size, cannot effect. Rope-dancers, harlequins, and
other performers of feats, are persons thus constituted.</p>
<p class='box'>How many contractions and relaxations of the same muscle? What is
said of the rapidity of muscular contractions in other animals? 167. When
are the involuntary muscles called into action? Why would it not have
been safe to trust these important operations to the exclusive control of the
will? 168. Give an instance where some of the muscles act under the
government of the will, conjoined with those that are involuntary. 169. On
what does the difference in muscular activity and strength depend?</p>
<p>170. Persons with small muscles, and largely developed
nervous systems, will sometimes exhibit very great muscular
power for a time; but it will not be of long continuance,
unless the brain is functionally diseased, as in hysteria,
delirium of fever, insanity, &amp;c. Men of large muscles and
small nerves can never perform feats of great strength; but
they have the power of endurance, and are better capacitated
for continued labor. Thus we cannot judge of the ability of
persons to make exertions and continue them, by their stature
alone. Strength, and the power of endurance, are the result
of a combination of well-developed muscles, large nerves,
and a full-sized, healthy, and active brain.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The muscles of fishes are large, and the
nerves distributed to them, comparatively small. The muscles
of birds are small, but their fibres are very compact.
The nerves appropriated to the muscles that are called into
action in flying, are large as well as numerous.</p>
<p>171. The contractile portion of a muscle is, in general, at
a distance from the part to be moved. Thus the principal
muscles that move the fingers are situated upon the forearm;
and when the limb is nearly or quite extended, the angle
formed by the part to be moved and the contractile muscles
is small. Again, the attachment of the muscles to the part
to be moved is near the joint that forms the fulcrum, (fig.&nbsp;45.)
By these arrangements there is a loss of power; but we are
compensated for this disadvantage by increased celerity of
movement, beauty of form, and adaptation of the limbs to the
varied pursuits of man.</p>
<p class='box'>170. What is said of those persons who have small muscles and largely
developed nervous systems? Of those who have large muscles and small
nerves? Upon what do strength and the power of endurance depend?
171. Why is there a loss of power in the action of the muscles?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> The muscle that bends the elbow acts at
disadvantage, and this is greatest when the arm is nearly or
quite extended, as the angle of action is then least. This
disadvantage is further increased by the attachment of the
motive muscles near the joint.</p>
<p>172. The number of muscles which are called into action
in the movements of the different joints, varies. The hinge-joints,
as the elbow, have two sets of muscles&mdash;one to bend
the joint, the other to extend it. The ball and socket joints,
as the shoulder, are not limited to mere flexion and <a name='TC_34'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">extension.</ins>
No joint in the system has the range of movement that is
possessed by that of the shoulder. By the action of the
muscles attached to the arm, it is not only carried upward and
forward, but forward and backward. Hence the arm may be
moved at any angle, by a combined action of its muscles.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> &ldquo;Could we behold properly the muscular
fibres in operation, nothing, as a mere mechanical exhibition,
can be conceived more superb than the intricate and combined
actions that must take place during our most common movements.
Look at a person running or leaping, or watch the
motions of the eye. How rapid, how delicate, how complicated,
and yet how accurate, are the motions required!
Think of the endurance of such a muscle as the heart, that
can contract, with a force equal to sixty pounds, seventy-five
times every minute, for eighty years together, without being
weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='note'><i>Note.</i> It would be a profitable exercise for pupils to press their
fingers upon prominent muscles, and, at the same time, vigorously
contract them, not only to learn their situations, but their use; as
the one that bends the arm, 14, fig.&nbsp;46.</p>
<p class='box'>How is this illustrated? 172. Do all joints require the same number of
muscles, when called into action? How many are called into action in the
movement of the elbow? What is their office? What is said of the
movement of the ball and socket joint?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE MUSCLES</h3>
</div>
<p>173. <i>The muscles should be used, in order that the size and
strength of these organs may be adequate to the demand made
upon them.</i> It is a law of the system that the action and
power of an organ are commensurate, to a certain extent, with
the demand made upon it; and it is a law of the muscular
system that, whenever a muscle is called into frequent use, its
fibres increase in thickness within certain limits, and become
capable of acting with greater force; while, on the contrary,
the muscle that is little used decreases in size and power.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. The blacksmith uses and rests the muscles
of his arm when striking upon the anvil. They not only
increase in size, but become very firm and hard.</p>
<p>2d. The student uses the muscles of the arm but little, in
holding his books and pen; they not only become small,
but soft.</p>
<p>3d. Let the student leave his books, and wield an iron
sledge, and the muscles of his arm will increase in size and
firmness. On the other hand, let the blacksmith assume the
student&rsquo;s vocation, and the muscles of his arm will become
soft and less firm.</p>
<p>174. <i>When the muscles are called into action, the flow of
blood in the arteries and veins is increased.</i> The increased
flow of blood in the arteries and veins, causes a more rapid
deposition of the particles of matter of which the muscles are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
composed. If the exercise is adequate to the power of the
system, the deposit of new material will exceed in quantity
the particles of matter removed, and both the size and energy
of the muscles are increased. But there is a limit to the
muscles becoming strong by labor. Sooner or later, man will
attain his growth or power; yet by judicious exercise, care,
and discreet management, the greatest power of the muscles
may be preserved until advanced age.</p>
<p class='box'>173&ndash;211. <i>Give the hygiene of the muscles.</i> 173. What is necessary that
muscles may attain size and strength? Give a law of the muscular system.
Show this by practical illustrations. 174. Why do muscles increase in size
when exercised?</p>
<p>175. <i>The muscles are lessened in size and diminished in
power when the exercise is continued so as to produce a feeling
of exhaustion.</i> The loss of material, in this instance, will
exceed the deposition of the atoms of matter. This is seen
in the attenuated frames of over-tasked domestic animals, as
the horse. The same truth is illustrated by the laborious
agriculturist, who, in consequence of too severe toil while
gathering the products of the field, frequently diminishes his
weight several pounds in a few weeks. Exercise, either for
pleasure or profit, may fatigue, yet it should never be protracted
to languor or exhaustion, if the individual desires &ldquo;a
green old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>176. <i>The same amount of exercise will not conduce to the
health of all individuals.</i> If riding or walking one mile
causes slight fatigue, this may be beneficial; while, by travelling
two miles, the exhaustion may be highly injurious.
Exercise and labor should be adapted to the strength of particular
individuals. How little soever the strength, that must
be the measure of exertion. Any other rule would be fatal
to the hopes of invigorating the system, either by exercise
or labor.</p>
<p class='box'>Is there a limit to the muscles becoming powerful by action? How may
the strength of muscles be kept until advanced age? 175. What is the
effect when exercise is continued until there is a feeling of exhaustion?
Give a practical illustration. What rule is mentioned in regard to exercise?
176. Can all persons take the same amount of exercise? What
rule is given as to the amount of exercise?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>177. <i>Relaxation must follow contraction, or, in other words,
rest must follow exercise.</i> The necessity of relaxation, when
a muscle has been called into action, is seen in the example
of a boy extending his arm with a book in his hand, as a
penalty. The boy can keep the arm extended but a short
time, make what effort he may. It is also seen in the restlessness
and feverish excitement that are evinced by persons
gazing on troops during days of review. The same is
noted in shopping. Such employments call into action the
muscles that support the spinal column in an erect position,
and the languor or uneasiness is muscular pain. The long-continued
tension of a muscle enfeebles its action, and eventually
destroys its contractility.</p>
<p>178. <i>In school, the small children, after sitting a short
time, become restless.</i> If their position be changed, their imperfectly
developed muscles will acquire tone, and will again
support the spinal column erect without pain. The necessity
for frequent recesses in school, is founded on the organic law
of muscular action alternating with rest. The younger and
feebler pupils are, the greater the necessity for frequent
recesses. We would not have the teacher think that one half
of the time should be spent in recesses; or the mother, that
her daughter is going to school to play. But we do maintain
that recesses should be given, and that they should be short
and frequent, especially for small and feeble scholars.</p>
<p>179. <i>Exhaustion is the inevitable result of continued muscular
contraction.</i> For example, let a lady ply the needle
quickly for some hours, and the muscles of the back and
right arm will become exhausted, which will be indicated by
a sense of weariness in these parts. A change of employment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
and position calls into action a different set of muscles,
and the exhausted organs are relieved.</p>
<p class='box'>177. What is said of the contraction and relaxation of the muscles? Give
examples of the necessity of relaxing the muscles. 178. Why should not
small children be confined in one position for a long time? What evils
result from this practice? What class of pupils should have recesses most
<a name='TC_36'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '?'">frequently?</ins> 179. What effect has continued muscular contraction?</p>
<p>180. <i>Much more labor will be accomplished by taking time
to relax the exhausted muscles</i>, or by so changing the employment
as to bring into action a new set of muscles; the woodman
thus relieves himself, by sawing and splitting alternately.
This principle applies to the labor of the horse and ox; and
it is also applicable to all kinds of employment. With the
invalid convalescing from fever, relapses result from inattention
to these laws. When a patient is recovering from sickness,
his physician should take care that his exercise be
proper, neither too much, too little, nor too long continued.</p>
<p>181. <i>The muscles of growing youths will not endure so
much exercise or labor as those of mature men.</i> In youth a
portion of the vital, or nervous energy of the system, is
expended upon the growth of the organs of the body, while
in the individual who has attained his growth, this expenditure
is not demanded; consequently severe labor or exercise
should not be imposed on growing children.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte,
his army was frequently recruited by mere boys. He complained
to the French government, because he was not supplied
with men of mature years, as the youths could not endure the
exertion of his forced marches.</p>
<p>182. <i>The muscles should be gradually called into action.</i>
These organs in action require more blood and nervous fluid
than when at rest. As the circulation of these fluids can only
be increased in a gradual manner, it follows, that, when the
muscular system has been in a state of rest, it should not suddenly
be called into vigorous action. On arising from a bed,
lounge, or chair, the first movements of the limbs should be
slow, and then gradually increased.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> if a man has a certain amount of work to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
perform in nine hours, and his muscles have been in a state
of rest, he will do it with less fatigue by performing half the
amount of the labor in five hours, and the remainder in four
hours. The same principle should be regarded in driving
horses and other beasts of burden.</p>
<p class='box'>180. How can the greatest amount of labor be secured with the least
exhaustion to the muscles? 181. Why should not severe labor be imposed
on growing children? 182. How should the muscles be called into action?</p>
<p>183. <i>The muscles should be rested gradually, when they
have been vigorously used.</i> If a person has been making great
muscular exertion in cutting wood, or any other employment,
instead of sitting down to rest, he should continue muscular
action, for a short time, by some moderate labor or amusement.</p>
<p>184. <i>If the system has been heated by muscular action, and
the skin is covered with perspiration, avoid sitting down</i> &ldquo;to
cool&rdquo; in a current of air; rather, put on more clothing,
and continue to exercise moderately. In instances when
severe action of the muscles has been endured, bathing and
rubbing the skin of the limbs and joints that have been used,
are of much importance. The laboring agriculturist and
industrious mechanic, by reducing to practice this suggestion,
would thus prevent soreness of the muscles, and stiffness of
the joints.</p>
<p>185. <i>The muscles should be abundantly supplied with pure
blood.</i> This state of the circulating fluid requires a healthy
condition of the digestive apparatus, and that the skin should
be kept warm by proper clothing, clean by bathing, and be
acted upon by pure air and good light; the movements
of the ribs and diaphragm should be unrestricted, and the
lungs should have ample volume and be supplied with pure
air. In all instances, muscular power is greatest when the
preceding conditions exist, as the muscles are then stimulated
by pure blood; consequently, it is of practical importance to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
the mechanic, the farmer, the man of leisure, and not less so
to the ladies, to observe these conditions, whatever vocation of
life they pursue.</p>
<p class='box'>183. How should the muscles be rested when they have been vigorously
used? 184. What precaution is given when the skin is covered with perspiration?
How may soreness of the muscles, consequent upon severe
action, be prevented? 185. Should the muscles be supplied with pure
blood? When is muscular power the greatest?</p>
<p>186. <i>The muscles should be used in pure air.</i> The purer
the air we breathe, the more stimulating the blood supplied to
the muscles, and the longer they can be used in labor, walking,
or sitting, without fatigue and injury; hence the benefit
derived in thoroughly ventilating all inhabited rooms. For the
same reason, if the air of the sick-room is pure, the patient
will sit up longer than when the air is impure.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is a common remark that sick persons will
sit up longer when riding in a carriage, than in an easy chair
in the room where they have lain sick. In the one instance,
they breathe pure air; in the other, usually, a confined, impure
air.</p>
<p>187. <i>The muscles should be exercised in the light.</i> Light,
particularly that of the sun, exercises more or less influence
on man and the inferior animals as well as on plants. Both
require the stimulus of this agent. Shops occupied by mechanics,
kitchens, and sitting-rooms, should be well lighted,
and situated on the sunny side of the house. Cellar kitchens
and underground shops should be avoided. For similar
reasons, students should take their exercise during the day,
rather than in the evening, and, as much as possible, laborers
should avoid night toil.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> Plants that grow in the shade, as under
trees, or in a dark cellar, are of lighter color and feebler
than those that are exposed to the light of the sun. Persons
that dwell in dark rooms are paler and less vigorous than
those who inhabit apartments well lighted, and exposed to the
rays of the sun.</p>
<p class='box'>186. Why should the muscles be used in pure air? Give a common
observation. 187. What effect has light on the muscular system? What
should the laborer avoid? Why should not students take their daily exercise
in the evening? How is the influence of solar light illustrated?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>188. <i>Exercise should be regular and frequent.</i> The system
needs this means of invigoration as regularly as it does
new supplies of food. It is no more correct that we devote
several days to a <i>proper</i> action of the muscles, and then
spend one day inactively, than it is to take a <i>proper</i> amount
of food for several days, and then withdraw this supply for
a day. The industrious mechanic and the studious minister
suffer as surely from undue confinement as the improvident
and indolent. The evil consequences of neglect of exercise
are gradual, and steal slowly upon an individual. But sooner
or later they are manifested in muscular weakness, dyspepsia,
and nervous irritability.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The custom among farmers of enduring
severe and undue toil for several successive days, and then
spending one or two days in idleness to <i>rest</i>, is injudicious.
It would be far better to do less in a day, and continue the
labor through the period devoted to idleness, and then no rest
will be demanded.</p>
<p>189. <i>Every part of the muscular system should have its
appropriate share of exercise.</i> Some employments call into
exercise the muscles of the upper limbs, as shoe-making;
others, the muscles of the lower limbs; while some, the muscles
of both upper and lower limbs, with those of the trunk,
as farming. In some kinds of exercise, the lower limbs are
mainly used, as in walking; in others, the upper limbs; and
again, the muscles of the trunk, together with those of the
upper and lower limbs, as in archery, quoits, playing ball.
Those trades and kinds of exercise are most salutary, in
which all the muscles have their due proportion of action,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
as this tends to develop and strengthen them equally. Thus
labor upon the farm and domestic employment are superior
as vocations, and archery, quoits, and dancing, if the air is
pure, among the pastimes. For sedentary persons, that kind
of exercise is best which calls into action the greatest number
of muscles.</p>
<p class='box'>188. How should exercise be taken? What is said respecting irregular
exercise? Are the consequences of neglected exercise immediately apparent?
What practical observation is given? 189. Should every muscle
have its due amount of exercise? Mention some employments that only
call into action the muscles of the upper limbs. Those of the lower limbs,
those of the trunk and limbs. Mention, in the different pastimes, what
muscles are called into action.</p>
<p>190. <i>The proper time for labor or exercise should be observed.</i>
This is modified by many circumstances. As a
general rule, the morning, when the air is pure and the ground
dry, is better than the evening; for then, the powers of the
body are greatest. Severe exercise and labor should be
avoided immediately before or after eating a full meal, for
the energies of the system are then required to perform the
digestive function. For similar reasons, it is not an appropriate
time for energetic muscular action immediately before
or after severe mental toil, as the powers of the system are
then concentrated upon the brain.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<p class='box'>What kinds of exercise are best? 190. What rule is given respecting
the time for exercise? 191. Why do the muscles require sleep? What is
the effect of an inversion of the law of rest?</p>
<p>191. <i>The muscles require sleep to restore their expended
energies.</i> Among the arrangements of creative wisdom, no
one harmonizes with the wants of the system more than the
alternation of day and night. The natural inclination of man
to sleep, is in the stilly hour of night, when all nature reposes,
and to be in action during the light of day. An inversion of
this law of rest causes greater exhaustion of the system than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
the same amount of exertion during daylight. This is illustrated
by the wearied and exhausted condition of watchers,
night-police, and other individuals who spend a part of the
night in some active business of life.</p>
<p>192. <i>The muscles should not be compressed.</i> Compression
prevents the blood from passing to the muscles with freedom;
consequently, they are not supplied with material to renovate
and promote their growth. Again, pressure stimulates the
lymphatics to action; and by the increased activity of these
vessels the muscles are attenuated. In the case of a man with
a fractured limb, the muscles are not only enfeebled by inaction,
but diminished in size by compression from the dressing.
Limbs enfeebled in this way will not recover their size, tone,
and strength, until the bandages are removed, and a proper
amount of exercise taken.</p>
<p>193. The pressure of tight dresses, under the name of a
&ldquo;snug fit,&rdquo; enfeebles the muscles of the back, and is a common
cause of projecting shoulders and curvature of the spinal
column. Thus every appendage to the dress of ladies which
prevents free motion of the muscles of the chest and spinal
column, weakens the muscles thus restrained, and not only
prevents the proper expansion of the lungs, but, by weakening
the muscles which sustain the spine, induces curvature and
disease. Whalebone, wood, steel, and every other unyielding
substance, should be banished from the toilet, as enemies of
the human race.</p>
<p>194. <i>The mind exerts a great influence upon the tone and
contractile energy of the muscular system.</i> A person acting
under a healthy mental stimulus will make exertion with less
fatigue than he would without this incentive. For this reason,
a sportsman will pursue his game miles without fatigue, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
his attendant, not having any mental stimulus, will become
weary. Again, if the sportsman spends some hours in
pursuit of his favorite game without success, a feeling of
languor creeps over him; but while he is thus fatigued and
dispirited, let him catch a glimpse of the game,&mdash;his wearied
feelings are immediately dissipated, and he presses on with
renewed energy and recruited strength.</p>
<p class='box'>192. Why should not the muscles be compressed? 193. What is the
effect of tight clothing upon the muscles? 194. What is said of the influence
of the mind upon muscular activity? Give an illustration of mental
stimulus co&ouml;perating with muscular activity in the case of a sportsman.</p>
<p>195. This principle was well illustrated in the retreat from
Russia of the defeated and dispirited French army. When no
enemy was near, they had hardly strength sufficient to carry
their arms; but no sooner did they hear the report of the
Russian guns, than new life seemed to pervade them, and they
wielded their weapons powerfully until the foe was repulsed,
then there was a relapse to weakness, and prostration followed.
It is thus with the invalid when riding for his health;&mdash;relate
an anecdote, or excite this mental stimulus by agreeable conversation,
and much benefit will accrue from the ride to the
debilitated person. So it is in the daily vocations of life; if
the mind have some incentive, the tiresomeness of labor will
be greatly diminished. Let an air of cheerfulness ever pervade
our every employment, and, like music, &ldquo;it sweetens
toil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>196. Facts illustrative of the inutility of calling the muscles
into action, without the co&ouml;peration of the mind, are seen in
the spiritless aspect of many of our boarding school processions,
when a walk is taken merely for exercise, without
having in view any attainable object. But present to the
mind a botanical or geological excursion, and the saunter
will be exchanged for the elastic step, the inanimate appearance
for the bright eye and glowing cheek. The difference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
is, simply, that, in the former case, the muscles are obliged to
work without that full nervous impulse so essential to their
energetic action; and that, in the latter, the nervous influence
is in full and harmonious operation.</p>
<p class='box'>195. Give an illustration of mental stimulus co&ouml;perating with muscular
activity in the case of the dispirited French army in their retreat from
Russia. How can a union of mental impulse and muscular action be beneficial
to an invalid? Does this same principle apply to those who labor?
196. Give an instance of the different effects produced by the absence and
presence of the mental <a name='TC_37'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">stimulus.</ins></p>
<p>197. It must not, however, be supposed that a walk simply
for the sake of exercise can never be beneficial. Every
one, unless prevented by disease, should consider it a duty to
take exercise every day in the open air; if possible, let it be
had in combination with harmonious mental exhilaration; if
not, let a walk, in an erect position, be made so brisk as to
produce rapid respiration and circulation of the blood, and in
a dress that shall not interfere with free motions of the arms
and free expansion of the chest.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The advantages of combining harmonious
mental excitement, with muscular activity, is thus given by
Dr. Armstrong:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>198. <i>The erect attitude lessens the exhaustion of the muscles.</i>
A person whose position is erect will stand longer, walk further,
and perform more labor, than an individual whose position is
stooping, but equal in all other respects. The manly port in
an erect attitude, depends chiefly upon the action of the muscles
of the back; and it follows that the fewer the muscles in
a state of tension, the less the draught upon the nervous system,
and the less its exhaustion. Another advantage which
attends the erect position is, the trunk and head are balanced
upon the bones and cartilages of the spinal column. If the
body slightly incline forward, the muscles attached to the
posterior side of the spine, by a gentle contraction, will bring
it to the perpendicular, and even incline it backward. This
is immediately removed by a slight contraction of the muscles
upon the anterior side of the spinal column.</p>
<p>199. In the erect position, there is a constant slight oscillation
of the body backward and forward, like the movement
of a pendulum; while, in the stooping posture, the muscles
on the posterior side of the spinal column are kept in a state
of continued tension and contraction, to prevent the body from
falling forward. This enfeebles the muscles of the back, and
exhausts the nervous energy, while the erect position favors
their development and power, because there is an alternate
contraction and relaxation of the muscles. Again, in the
stooping position, the lower limbs are curved at the knee. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
this attitude, there is a constant tension of the muscles of the
lower extremities, which produces muscular exhaustion.</p>
<p class='box'>198. Why will a person who stands erect walk further, and perform more
labor, than if he assumed the stooping posture? 199. Why are the muscles
of the back so soon exhausted in the stooping position?</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>200. When it is necessary to call into action a part of the
muscles of the system in the performance of any duty, as
those of the lower limbs in walking, if the muscles of other
parts are in a state of inaction, the influence of the nervous
system can be determined in an undivided manner upon those
parts of the lower limbs in action; hence they will not so soon
become wearied or exhausted, as when this influence is divided
between a greater number of muscles. In performing any
labor, as in speaking, reading, singing, mowing, sewing, <a name='TC_39'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added comma.">&amp;c.,</ins>
there will be less exhaustion, and the effort can be longer
maintained in the erect position of the body and head, than in
a stooping attitude.</p>
<p><i>Experiment.</i> Hold in each hand a pail of water or equal
weights, in a stooping posture, as long as it can be done
without much suffering and injury. Again, when the muscular
pain has ceased, hold the same pails of water, for the
same length of time, in an erect posture, and note the difference
in the fatigue of the muscles.</p>
<p>201. If the stooping posture is acquired in youth, we are
quite certain of seeing the deformed shoulders in old age.
Hence the importance of duly exercising the muscles of the
back, for when they are properly developed, the child can and
will stand erect. In this attitude, the shoulders will be thrown
back, and the chest will become broad and full.</p>
<p>202. Pupils, while standing during recitations, often inadvertently
assume the attitude represented by fig.&nbsp;49, and it is
the duty of teachers to correct this position when assumed.
When a child or adult has contracted a habit of stooping, and
has become round-shouldered, it can be measurably, and generally,
wholly, remedied by moderate and repeated efforts to
bring the shoulders back, and the spinal column in an erect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
position. This deformity can and should be remedied in our
schools. It may take months to accomplish the desired end,
yet it can be done as well under the direction of the kind
instructor, as under the stern, military drill sergeant, who never
fails to correct this deformity among his raw recruits.</p>
<p class='box'>200. What suggestion when it is necessary to call into action a part of
the muscular system? Give the experiment that illustrates this principle.

</p>
</div>
<p>203. <i>The child should be taught to sit erect when employed
in study or work.</i> This attitude favors a healthy action of the
various organs of the system, and conduces to beauty and
symmetry of form. Scholars are more or less inclined to lean
forward and place the elbow on the table or desk, for support
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and this is often done when their seats are provided with
backs. Where there is a predisposition to curvature of the
spine, no position is more unfavorable or more productive of
deformities than this; for it is usually continued in one direction,
and the apparent deformity it induces is a projection of
the shoulders. If the girl is so feeble that she cannot sit
erect, as represented by fig.&nbsp;50, let her stand or recline on a
couch; either is preferable to the position represented by fig.&nbsp;51.

<p>204. <i>The muscles, when exhausted, cannot endure continued
effort.</i> When the energies of the muscular system have been
expended by severe and long-continued exercise, or the brain
and nervous system prostrated by protracted mental effort, the
muscles are unfitted to maintain the body erect in standing or
sitting for a long time, as the nervous system, in its exhausted
state, cannot supply a sufficient amount of its peculiar influence
to maintain the supporting muscles of the body and head
in a state of contraction. Hence, a child or adult, when much
fatigued, should not be compelled to stand or sit erect in one
posture, but should be permitted to vary the position frequently,
as this rests and recruits both the muscular and the
nervous system.</p>
<p>205. <i>A slight relaxation of the muscles tends to prevent
their exhaustion.</i> In walking, dancing, and most of the
mechanical employments, there will be less fatigue, and the
movements will be more graceful, when the muscles are
slightly relaxed. When riding in cars or coaches, the system
does not suffer so severely from the jar if there is a slight
relaxation of the muscles, as when they are in a state of rigid
contraction.</p>
<p><i>Experiments.</i> Attempt to bow with the muscles of the
limbs and trunk rigid, and there will be a stiff bending of the
body only at the hip-joint. On the other hand, attempt to bow
with the muscles moderately relaxed; the ankle, the knee,
and the hip-joint will slightly bend, accompanied with an easy
and graceful curve of the body.</p>
<p>206. The muscles when relaxed, together with the yielding
character of the cartilage, and the porous structure of the ends
of the bones that form a joint, diffuse or deaden the force of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
jars, or shocks, in stepping suddenly down stairs, or in falling
from moderate heights. Hence, in jumping or falling
from a carriage, or any height, the shock to the organs of
the system may be obviated in the three following ways:
1st. Let the muscles be relaxed, not rigid. 2d. Let the
limbs be bent at the ankle, knee, and hips; the head should
be thrown slightly forward, with the trunk a little stooping.
3d. Fall upon the toes, not the heel.</p>
<p class='box'>204. When are the muscles unfitted to maintain the system erect either
in standing or sitting? What is necessary when this condition of the
system exists? 205. Why should the muscular system be slightly relaxed
in walking, &amp;c.? Give illustrative experiments. 206. What is the reason
that we do not feel the jar in falling from a moderate height?</p>
<p><i>Experiments.</i> Stand with the trunk and lower limbs firm,
and the muscles rigid; then jump a few inches perpendicularly
to the floor, and fall upon the heels. Again, slightly
bend the limbs, jump a few inches, and fall upon the toes, and
the difference in the force of the shock, to the brain and other
organs, will be readily noticed.</p>
<p>207. <i>The muscles require to be educated, or trained.</i> The
power of giving different intonations in reading, speaking, singing,
the varied and rapid executions in penmanship, and all
mechanical or agricultural employments, depend, in a measure,
upon the education of the muscles. In the first effort of muscular
education, the contractions of the muscular fibres are
irregular and feeble, as may be seen when the child begins to
walk, or in the first efforts of penmanship.</p>
<p>208. <i>Repetition of muscular action is necessary.</i> To render
the action of the muscles complete and effective, they must
be called into action repeatedly and at proper intervals. This
education must be continued until not only each muscle, but
every fibre of the muscle, is fully under the control of the
will. In this way persons become skilful in every employment.
In training the muscles for effective action, it is very
important that correct movements be adopted at the commencement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
If this is neglected, the motions will be constrained
and improper, while power and skill will be lost.</p>
<p class='box'>How is this shown by experiment? 207. Upon what do the different
intonations of sound or mechanical employments depend? Why are the
first efforts in educating the muscles indifferent or irregular? 208. Why
is repetition of muscular action necessary? Why is it important that
correct movements be adopted in the first efforts of muscular education?</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> If a boy, while learning to mow, is allowed
to swing his scythe in a stooping position, twisting his body at
every sweep of the scythe, he will never become an easy,
efficient mower. Proper instruction is as necessary in many
of the agricultural branches as in the varied mechanical
employments.</p>

<p>209. <i>Good penmanship requires properly trained muscles.</i>
To a deficient analysis of the movements of the arm, hand,
and fingers, on the part of teachers and pupils in penmanship,
together with an improper position in sitting, is to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
ascribed the great want of success in acquiring this art. The
pen should be held loosely, and when the proper position is
attained, the scholar should make an effort to imitate some
definite copy as nearly as possible. The movements of the
fingers, hand, and arm, necessary to accomplish this, should
be made with ease and rapidity, striving, at each effort, to
imitate the copy more nearly.</p>
<p class='box'>How is this illustrated? 209. Why have so many pupils failed in
acquiring good penmanship?</p>
<p>210. When the arm, hand, and fingers are rigid, the large
muscles, that bend and extend these parts, are called into too
intense action. This requires of the small muscles, that produce
the lateral movements, which are essential to rapidity in
writing, an effort which they cannot make, or can with difficulty
accomplish.</p>
<p><i>Experiment.</i> Vigorously extend the fingers by a violent
and rigid contraction of the muscles upon the lower part of
the arm, and the lateral movement which is seen in their separation
cannot be made. But gently extend the fingers, and
their oblique movements are made with freedom.</p>
<p>211. An individual who is acquainted with the laws of
health, whose muscles are well trained, will perform a certain
amount of labor with less fatigue and waste to the system,
than one who is ignorant of the principles of hygiene, and
whose muscles are imperfectly trained. Hence the laboring
poor have a deep interest in acquiring a knowledge of practical
physiology, as well as skill in their trade or vocation. It
is emphatically true to those who earn their bread by the
&ldquo;sweat of their brow,&rdquo; that &ldquo;knowledge is power.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE TEETH.</h3>
</div>
<p>212. <span class='smcap'>The</span> teeth, in composition, nutrition, and growth,
are different from other bones of the body. They vary in
number at different periods of life, and, unlike other bones,
they are exposed to the immediate action of atmospheric air
and foreign substances. The bones of the system, generally,
when fractured, unite; but there is never a permanent union
of a tooth when broken.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE TEETH.</h3>
</div>
<p>213. The <span class='smcaplc'>TEETH</span> are attached to the upper and lower jaw-bone,
by means of bony sockets, called <i>al&acute;ve-o-lar</i> processes.
These give great solidity to the attachment of the teeth, and
frequently render their extraction difficult. The gums, by
their fibrous, fleshy structure, serve to fix the teeth more
firmly in the jaw.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When a <i>permanent</i> tooth is extracted, these
bony processes are gradually absorbed, so that in advanced
age there remains only the jaw-bone covered by the lining
membrane of the gum. This accounts for the narrow jaw
and falling in of the lips in old age. Frequently, a piece of
the alveolar process comes out with the tooth when extracted,
and the dentist has then the credit of &ldquo;breaking the jaw.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
No great injury results from the removal of the process in this
manner.</p>
<p class='box'>212. What is said of the teeth? In what respect do they differ from other
bones of the body? 213&ndash;218. <i>Give the anatomy of the teeth.</i> 213. What
confines the teeth in the jaw-bone? What becomes of the socket when a
tooth is removed? What effect has this absorption upon the jaw and
lips?</p>
<p>214. The teeth are formed in the interior of the jaws, and
within <i>dent&acute;al cap&acute;sules</i>, (membranous pouches,) which are
enclosed within the substance of the bone, and present in
their interior a fleshy bud, or granule, from the surface of
which exudes the ivory, or the bony part of the tooth. In
proportion as the tooth is formed, it rises in the socket, which
is developed simultaneously with the tooth, and passes through
the gum, and shows itself without.</p>

in each jaw. Between six and fourteen years of age, the temporary
teeth are removed, and the second set appears, called
<i>per&acute;ma-nent</i> teeth. They number thirty-two, sixteen in each
jaw.</p>

tooth;) the next two, <i>bi-cus&acute;pids</i>, (small grinders;) the next
two, <i>mo&acute;lars</i>, (grinders.) The last one on each side of the
jaw is called a <i>wisdom tooth</i>, because it does not appear until
a person is about twenty years old. The incisors, cuspids,
and bicuspids, have each but one root. The molars of the
upper jaw have three roots, while those of the lower jaw have
but two.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The shape of the teeth in different species of
animals is adapted to the kind of food on which they subsist.
Those animals that feed exclusively on flesh, as the lion, have
the cuspids, or canine teeth, largely developed, and the molars
have sharp cutting points. Those animals that feed on grass
and grain, as the horse and the sheep, have their molar teeth
more rounded and flat on the crown. The human teeth are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
adapted to feed on fruits, grain, or flesh, as they are less
pointed than those of the cat, and more pointed than those of
the sheep.</p>
<p class='box'>216. Give the names of the permanent teeth. What teeth have but one
root, or &ldquo;fang&rdquo;? How many roots have the molars of the upper jaw?
Of the lower jaw? What is said of the shape of the teeth in different
species of animals?</p>
<p>217. The teeth are composed principally of two substances&mdash;the
<i>i&acute;vo-ry</i> and the <i>en-am&acute;el</i>. The internal part of the tooth
or the ivory, is harder and more enduring than bone, and forms
the body of the tooth. The enamel is remarkable for its hardness,
and varies somewhat in color with the age, temperament,
habits, and manner of living of different individuals. When
any part of the enamel is destroyed, it is never regenerated.</p>

<p>218. Each tooth is divided into two parts, namely, <i>crown</i>
and <i>root</i>. The crown is that part which protrudes from the
jaw-bone and gum, and is covered by the highly polished
enamel. The root, or &ldquo;fang,&rdquo; is placed in the sockets of the
jaw, and consists of bony matter. Through this bony substance
several small vessels pass, to aid in the growth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
also in the removal of the tooth. There are, beside these
vessels, small white cords passing to each tooth, called <i>nerves</i>.
(See fig.&nbsp;57.) When these nerves are diseased, we have the
toothache.</p>
<p class='box'>217. Give the structure of the teeth. What is said of the enamel?

root. What vessels pass through the bony matter? What is their use?</p>

<a name='PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_TEETH' id='PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_TEETH'></a>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE TEETH.</h3>
</div>
<p>219. The use of the teeth is twofold. 1st. By the action
of the incisors the food is divided, while the molars grind or
break down the more solid portions of it. By these processes,
the food is prepared to pass more easily and rapidly into the
stomach.</p>
<p>220. In the mastication of food there are two movements
of the lower jaw&mdash;the action by which the teeth are brought
together, and the lateral motion. In the former, the food is
cut or divided, the jaws acting like shears. This movement
is produced by the action of two large muscles situated on
each side of the head and face.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The muscles attached to the lower jaw are of
great strength; by their action alone, some persons are enabled
to bite the hardest substances. By putting the fingers
upon the side of the head above and in front of the ears, and
upon the face above the angle of the jaw, while masticating
food, the alternate swelling and relaxation of these muscles
will be clearly felt.</p>
<p>221. The lateral, or grinding movement of the teeth, is produced
by the action of a strong muscle that is attached to the
lower jaw on the inside.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Those animals that live solely on flesh, have
only the cutting, or shear-like movement of the jaws. Those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
that use vegetables for food, have the grinding motion; while
man has both the cutting and grinding movement.</p>
<p class='box'>219&ndash;222. <i>Give the physiology of the teeth.</i> 219. Give one of the functions
of the teeth. 220. How many movements of the lower jaw in masticating
food? What effect has the first movement upon the food? How produced?
What is the character of the masticating muscles? 221. How is
the grinding motion of the teeth produced? What is said of the movements
of the teeth in different animals?</p>
<p>222. 2d. The teeth aid us in articulating with distinctness
certain letters and words. An individual who has lost his
front teeth cannot enunciate distinctly certain letters called
dental. Again, as the alveolar processes are removed by
absorption soon after the removal of the teeth, the lips and
cheeks do not retain their former full position, thus marring, in
no slight degree, the symmetry of the lower part of the face.
Consequently, those simple observances that tend to the
preservation of the teeth are of great practical interest to all
persons.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='HYGIENE_OF_THE_TEETH' id='HYGIENE_OF_THE_TEETH'></a>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE TEETH.</h3>
</div>
<p>223. <i>To preserve the teeth, they must be kept clean.</i> After
eating food, they should be cleansed with a brush and water,
or rubbed with a piece of soft flannel, to prevent the <i>tartar</i>
collecting, and to remove the pieces of food that may have
lodged between them. Toothpicks may be useful in removing
any particles inaccessible to the brush. They may be
made of bone, ivory, or the common goose-quill. Metallic
toothpicks should not be used, as they injure the enamel.</p>
<p>224. <i>The mouth should be cleansed with pure tepid water at
night, as well as in the morning</i>; after which the teeth should
be brushed upward and downward, both on the posterior and
anterior surfaces. It may be beneficial to use refined soap,
once or twice every week, to remove any corroding substance
that may exist around the teeth; care being taken to thoroughly
rinse the mouth after its use.</p>
<p>225. <i>Food or drink should not be taken into the mouth
when very hot or very cold.</i> Sudden changes of temperature
will crack the enamel, and finally produce decayed teeth.</p>
<p class='box'>222. What is another use of the teeth? 223&ndash;232. <i>Give the hygiene
of the teeth.</i> 223. How can the teeth be preserved? By what means?
224. How often should they be cleansed? 225. What is said of very hot
or cold drinks?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> On this account, smoking is pernicious, because
the teeth are subjected to an alternate inhalation of both
cold and warm air.</p>
<p>226. <i>The temporary teeth should be removed as soon as
they become loose.</i> If a permanent tooth makes it appearance
before the first is removed, or has become loose, the
milk tooth, although not loose, should be removed without
delay. This is necessary that the second set of teeth may
present a regular and beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>227. <i>In general, when the permanent teeth are irregular,
one or more should be removed.</i> If the teeth are crowded and
irregular, in consequence of the jaw being narrow and short,
or when they press so hard upon each other as to injure the
enamel, remove one or more to prevent their looking unsightly,
and in a few months the remaining teeth, with a little care,
will fill the spaces.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When it is necessary to remove a tooth, apply
to some skilful operator. It requires as much skill and knowledge
to extract teeth <i>well</i>, as it does to amputate a limb; yet
some persons, who possess strong arms, will obtain a pair of
forceps, or a tooth-key, and hang out the sign of &ldquo;surgeon-dentist,&rdquo;
although ignorant of the principles that should guide
them.</p>
<p>228. <i>It is not always necessary to have teeth extracted when
they ache.</i> The nerve, or the investing membrane of the
root, may be diseased, and the tooth still be sound. In such
instances, the tooth should not be extracted, but the diseased
condition may be remedied by proper medication. There are
many sound teeth, that become painful, as already mentioned,
which are unnecessarily removed.</p>
<p class='box'>Why is smoking injurious to the teeth? 226. What remark respecting
the temporary teeth? 227. What remarks respecting the permanent
teeth? Do those persons that extract teeth require skill as well as knowledge?
228. Why should not teeth be extracted at all times when they
are painful?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> Dr. H. M., of Belfast, Me., related to me that
an individual in that vicinity had his teeth, (all of them
sound,) on one side of the lower jaw, extracted by an ignoramus
of a &ldquo;tooth-puller,&rdquo; and this without any relief from
pain. The disease was tic douloureux, which was relieved
by Dr. M.</p>
<p>229. <i>The preservation of the teeth requires that they be
frequently examined.</i> When a part of the enamel is removed,
and a small portion of the body of the tooth has become carious,
in many instances such teeth may be preserved from
further decay by having them filled or &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; with <i>gold
foil</i>. All amalgams, pastes, and cheap patent articles for
filling, should be avoided, if you would preserve both the teeth
and the general health.</p>
<p>230. The practice of cracking nuts with the teeth, or of
lifting heavy bodies, and the constant habit of biting thread,
should be avoided, as they finally destroy the enamel.</p>
<p>231. <i>All acidulated drinks and mineral waters, that &ldquo;set
the teeth on edge,&rdquo; are injurious.</i> All tooth-powders and
washes that contain any article that is acid, corrosive, or grinding,
should be banished from the toilet. Tobacco is not a preservative
of the teeth. It contains &ldquo;grit,&rdquo; which wears away
the enamel; beside, when chewed, it debilitates the vessels of
the gums, turns the teeth yellow, and renders the breath and
the appearance of the mouth disagreeable.</p>
<p>232. Healthy persons have generally sound teeth, while
feeble persons have decayed teeth. For this reason, we should
try to learn and practise the few simple rules that promote
health.</p>
<p class='box'>Give an illustration of the removal of sound teeth. 229. How may
decaying teeth be preserved? What should be avoided in the filling of
teeth? 230. What practices should also be avoided? 231. What is said
of acidulated drinks? What effect has the chewing of tobacco upon the
teeth? 232. What is one reason for preserving health?</p>

mouth.</p>
<p><span class='smcaplc'>MOUTH</span> is an irregular cavity, which contains the
instruments of mastication and the organs of taste. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
bounded in front by the lips; on each side by the internal
surface of the cheeks; above, by the <i>hard palate</i> (roof of the
mouth) and teeth of the upper jaw; below, by the tongue and
teeth of the lower jaw; behind, it is continuous with the
pharynx, but is separated from it by a kind of movable
curtain, called the <i>soft palate</i>. This may be elevated or
depressed, so as to close the passage or leave it free.</p>
<p>237. The <span class='smcaplc'>SALIVARY GLANDS</span> are six in number; three on
each side of the jaw. They are called the <i>pa-rot&acute;id</i>, the
<i>sub-max&acute;il-la-ry</i> and the <i>sub-lin&acute;gual</i>.</p>

<p>241. The <span class='smcaplc'>PHARYNX</span> is a membranous sac, situated upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
upper portion of the spinal column. It extends from the base
of the skull to the top of the <i>tra&acute;che-a</i>, (windpipe,) and is
continuous with the &oelig;sophagus. From the pharynx are four
passages; one opens upward and forward to the nose, the
second leads forward to the mouth, the third downward to the
trachea and lungs, the fourth downward and backward to the
stomach.</p>
<p>242. The <span class='smcap'>&OElig;SOPHAGUS</span> is a large membranous tube that
extends behind the trachea, the heart, and lungs, pierces
the diaphragm, and terminates in the stomach. It is composed
of two membranes&mdash;an internal, or mucous, and a
muscular coat. The latter is composed of two sets of fibres;
one extends lengthwise, the other is arranged in circular
bands.</p>
<p>243. The <span class='smcaplc'>STOMACH</span> is situated in the left side of the abdomen,
immediately below and in contact with the diaphragm.
It has two openings; one connected with the &oelig;sophagus,
called the <i>car&acute;di-ac</i> orifice; the other connected with the
upper portion of the small intestine, called the <i>py-lor&acute;ic</i>
orifice. It is composed of three coats, or membranes. The
exterior or serous coat is very tough and strong, and invests
every part of this important organ. The middle, or
muscular coat is composed of two layers of muscular fibres,
one set of which is arranged longitudinally, the other circularly.
The interior coat is called the mucous, and is arranged
in <i>ru&acute;g&aelig;</i>, (folds.) The stomach is provided with a multitude
of small glands, in which is secreted the gastric fluid.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> The three coats of the stomach anatomically
resemble tripe, which is a preparation of the largest stomach of
the cow or ox. The outer coat is smooth and highly polished.
The middle coat is composed of minute threads, which are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
arranged in two layers. The fibres of these layers cross each
other. The inner coat is soft, and presents many folds, usually
named &ldquo;the honey-comb.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>241. Describe the pharynx and the passages leading from it. 242. Give

</div>
<p>244. The <span class='smcaplc'>INTESTINES</span>, or alimentary canal, are divided into
two parts&mdash;the <i>small</i> and <i>large</i>. The small intestine is about
twenty-five feet in length, and is divided into three portions,
namely, the <i>Du-o-de&acute;num</i>, the <i>Je-ju&acute;num</i>, and the <i>Il&acute;e-um</i>.
The large intestine is about five feet in length, and is divided
into three parts, namely, the <i>C&aelig;&acute;cum</i>, the <i>Co&acute;lon</i>, and the
<i>Rec&acute;tum</i>. (<a href='#APPENDIX_D'>Appendix D.</a>)</p>
<p>245. The <span class='smcaplc'>DUODENUM</span> is somewhat larger than the rest of
the small intestine, and has received its name from being in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
length about the breadth of twelve fingers. It commences at
the pylorus, and ascends obliquely backward to the under
surface of the liver. It then descends perpendicularly in
front of the right kidney, and passes transversely across the
lower portion of the spinal column, behind the colon, and
terminates in the jejunum. The ducts from the liver and
pancreas open into the perpendicular portion, about six inches
from the stomach.</p>
<p class='box'>244. Explain fig.&nbsp;60. What is the length of the small intestine, and
how is it divided? What is the length of the large intestine? Give its
divisions. 245. Describe the duodenum.</p>
<p>246. The <span class='smcaplc'>JEJUNUM</span> is continuous with the duodenum. It
is thicker than the rest of the small intestine, and has a
pinkish tinge.</p>
<p>247. The <span class='smcaplc'>ILEUM</span> is smaller, and thinner in texture, and
somewhat paler, than the jejunum. There is no mark to distinguish
the termination of the one or the commencement of
the other. The ileum terminates near the right haunch-bone,
by a valvular opening into the colon at an obtuse angle.
This arrangement prevents the passing of substances from the
colon into the ileum. The jejunum and ileum are surrounded
above and at the sides by the colon.</p>
<p>248. The small intestine, like the stomach, has three coats.
The inner, or mucous coat is thrown into folds, or valves. In
consequence of this valvular arrangement, the mucous membrane
is more extensive than the other tissues, and gives a
greater extent of surface with which the aliment comes in
contact. There are imbedded under this membrane an
immense number of minute glands, and it has a great number
of piles, like those upon velvet. For this reason, this membrane
is sometimes called the <i>vil&acute;lous</i> coat.</p>
<p>249. The <a name='TC_47'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'C&OElig;CUM'"><span class='smcap'>C&AElig;CUM</span></ins> is the blind pouch, or cul-de-sac, at the
commencement of the large intestine. Attached to its extremity
is the <i>ap-pend&acute;ix verm-i-form&acute;is</i>, (a long, worm-shaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
tube.) It is from one to six inches in length, and of
the size of a goose-quill.</p>

<p>250. The <span class='smcaplc'>COLON</span> is divided into three parts&mdash;the <i>ascending</i>,
<i>transverse</i>, and <i>descending</i>. The ascending colon passes
upward from the right haunch-bone to the under surface of
the liver. It then bends inward, and crosses the upper part
of the abdomen, below the liver and stomach, to the left side
under the name of the transverse colon. At the left side, it
turns, and descends to the left haunch-bone, and is called the
descending colon. Here it makes a peculiar curve upon itself,
which is called the <i>sig&acute;moid flex&acute;ure</i>.</p>

<p>251. The <span class='smcaplc'>RECTUM</span> is the termination of the large intestine.
The large intestine has three coats, like the stomach and
small intestine. The longitudinal fibres of the muscular coat
are collected into three bands. These bands are nearly one
half shorter than the intestine, and give it a sacculated
appearance, which is characteristic of the <a name='TC_50'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'c&oelig;cum'">c&aelig;cum</ins> and colon.</p>
<p>252. The <span class='smcaplc'>LACTEALS</span> are minute vessels, which commence
in the villi, upon the mucous surface of the small intestine.
From the intestine they pass between the membranes of the
<i>mes&acute;en-ter-y</i> to small glands, which they enter. The first
range of glands collects many small vessels, and transmits a
few larger branches to a second range of glands; and, finally,
after passing through several successive ranges of these
glandular bodies, the lacteals, diminished in number and increased
in size, proceed to the enlarged portion of the thoracic
duct, into which they open. They are most numerous in the
upper portion of the small intestine.</p>
<p>253. The <span class='smcaplc'>THORACIC DUCT</span> commences in the abdomen, by
a considerable dilatation, which is situated in front of the lower
portion of the spinal column. From this point, it passes
through the diaphragm, and ascends to the lower part of the
neck. In its ascent, it lies anterior to the spine, and by the
side of the aorta and &oelig;sophagus. At the lower part of the
neck, it makes a sudden turn downward and forward, and
terminates by opening into a large vein which passes to the
heart. The thoracic duct is equal in diameter to a goose-quill,
and, at its termination, is provided with a pair of semilunar
valves, which prevent the admission of venous blood
into its cylinder.</p>
<p class='box'>251. What is said of the arrangement of the fibres of the muscular coat
of the large intestine? 252. What are the lacteals? Give their course

<p class='box'>Explain fig.&nbsp;62. What is said respecting the mesenteric glands?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The mesenteric glands, which are situated
between two layers of serous membrane (mesentery) that
connects the small intestine with the spinal column, occasionally
become diseased in childhood, and prevent the chyle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
from passing to the thoracic duct. Children thus affected have
a voracious appetite, and at the same time are becoming more
and more emaciated. The disease is called mesenteric consumption.</p>
<p>254. The <span class='smcaplc'>LIVER</span>, a gland appended to the alimentary canal,
is the largest organ in the system, and weighs about four
pounds. It is situated in the right side, below the diaphragm,
and is composed of several lobes. Its upper surface is convex;
its under, concave. This organ is retained in its place
by several ligaments. It performs the double office of separating
impurities from the venous blood, and of secreting a
fluid (bile) necessary to chylification. On the under surface
of the liver is a membranous sac, called the <i>gall-cyst</i>, which
is generally considered as a reservoir for the bile.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the salivary glands. It is about six inches in length, weighs
three or four ounces, and is situated transversely across the

organ, situated in the left side, in contact with the diaphragm,
stomach, and the pancreas. It is of a dark, bluish
color, and is abundantly supplied with blood, but has no duct
which serves as an outlet for any secretion. Its use is not
well determined.</p>

</div>
<p>259. <span class='smcap'>Substances</span> received into the stomach as food, must
necessarily undergo many changes before they are fitted to
form part of the animal body. The solid portions are reduced
to a fluid state, and those parts that will nourish the
body are separated from the waste material.</p>
<p>260. The first preparation of food for admission into the
system, consists in its proper mastication. The lips in front,
the cheeks upon the side, the soft palate, by closing down
upon the base of the tongue, retain the food in the mouth,
while it is subjected to the; process of <i>mas-ti-ca&acute;tion</i>, (chewing.)
The tongue rolls the mass around, and keeps it between
the teeth, while they divide the food to a fineness suitable for
the stomach.</p>
<p>261. While the food is in process of mastication, there is
incorporated with it a considerable amount of <i>sa-li&acute;va</i>, (spittle.)
This fluid is furnished by the salivary glands, situated in the
vicinity of the mouth. The saliva moistens and softens the
food, so that, when carried into the pharynx. it is passed, with
ease, through the &oelig;sophagus into the stomach.</p>
<p>262. When the food has been properly masticated, (and in
rapid eaters when it is not,) the soft palate is raised from the
base of the tongue backward, so as to close the posterior opening
through the nostrils. By a movement of the muscles of
the tongue, cheeks, and floor of the mouth, simultaneous with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
that of the soft palate, the food is pressed into the upper part
of the pharynx.</p>
<p class='box'>259&ndash;272. <i>Give the physiology of the digestive organs.</i> 259. What is necessary
before food can nourish the body? 260. Describe how mastication is
performed. 261. Of what use is the saliva in the process of mastication?
262. How is the food pressed into the pharynx?</p>
<p>263. When in the pharynx, the food and drink are prevented
from passing into the trachea by a simple valve-like
arrangement, called the <i>ep-i-glot&acute;tis</i>. The ordinary position
of this little organ is perpendicular, so as not to obstruct the
passage of air into the lungs; but in the act of swallowing,
it is brought directly over the opening of the trachea, called
the <i>glot&acute;tis</i>. The food, being forced backward, passes rapidly
over the epiglottis into the &oelig;sophagus, where the circular band
of muscular fibres above, contracts and forces the food to the
next lower band. Each band relaxes and contracts successively,
and thus presses the alimentary ball downward and
onward to the stomach.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If air is inhaled when the food or drink is
passing over the glottis, some portions of it may be carried
into the larynx or trachea. This produces violent spasmodic
coughing, and most generally occurs when an attempt is made
to speak while masticating food; therefore, never talk when
the mouth contains food.</p>
<p class='box'>263. When the food is in the pharynx, how is it prevented from passing
into the trachea, or windpipe? Describe how it is passed into the stomach?
Give the observation. 264. Describe how the food in the stomach
is converted into chyme.</p>
<p>264. When the food reaches the stomach, the gastric glands
are excited to action, and they secrete a powerful solvent,
called gastric juice. The presence of food in the stomach also
increases a contractile action of the muscular coat, by which
the position of the food is changed from one part of this cavity
to another. Thus the aliment is brought in contact with the
mucous membrane, and each portion of it becomes saturated
with gastric juice, by which it is softened, or dissolved into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
a pulpy homogeneous mass, of a creamy consistence, called
<i>Chyme</i>. The food is not all converted into chyme at the same
time; but as fast as it is changed, it passes through the pyloric
orifice into the duodenum.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The gastric juice has the property of coagulating
liquid albuminous matter when mixed with it. It is
this property of rennet, which is an infusion of the fourth
stomach of the calf, by which milk is coagulated, or formed
into &ldquo;curd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>265. The <span class='smcaplc'>CHYME</span> is conveyed through the pyloric orifice of
the stomach into the duodenum. The chyme not only excites
an action in the duodenum, but also in the liver and pancreas.
<i>Mucus</i> is then secreted by the duodenum, <i>bile</i> by the liver,
and <i>pancreatic fluid</i> by the pancreas. The bile and pancreatic
fluid are conveyed into the duodenum, and mixed with
the chyme. By the action of these different fluids, the chyme
is converted into a fluid of a whitish color, called <i>Chyle</i>, and
into residuum.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The bile has no agency in the change
through which the food passes in the stomach. In a healthy
condition of this organ, no bile is found in it. The common
belief, that the stomach has a redundancy of this secretion, is
erroneous. If bile is ejected in vomiting, it merely shows,
not only that the action of the stomach is inverted, but also
that of the duodenum. A powerful emetic will, in this way,
generally bring this fluid from the most healthy stomach. A
knowledge of this fact might save many a stomach from the
evils of emetics, administered on false impressions of their
necessity, and continued from the corroboration of these by
the appearance of bile, till derangement, and perhaps permanent

<p>266. The <span class='smcaplc'>CHYLE</span> and residual matter are moved over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
mucous surface of the small intestine, by the action of its
muscular coat. As the chyle is carried along the tract of the
intestine, it comes in contact with the villi, where the lacteal
vessels commence. These imbibe, or take up, the chyle, and
transfer it through the mesenteric glands into the thoracic duct,
through which it is conveyed into a large vein at the lower
part of the neck. In this vein the chyle is mixed with the
venous fluid. The residual matter is conveyed into the large
intestine, through which it is carried and excreted from the
system. (<a href='#APPENDIX_E'>Appendix E.</a>)</p>

five different changes. 1st. The chewing and admixture of
the saliva with the food; this process is called <i>mastication</i>.</p>
<p>268. 2d. The change through which the food passes in
the stomach by its muscular contraction, and the secretion
from the gastric glands; this is called <i>chymification</i>.</p>

the agency of the bile and pancreatic secretions, into a fluid
of milk-like appearance; this is <i>chylification</i>.</p>
<p>270. 4th. The absorption of the chyle by the lacteals,
and its transfer through them and the thoracic duct, into the
subclavian vein at the lower part of the neck.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a></p>
<p>271. 5th. The separation and excretion of the residuum.</p>
<p>272. Perfection of the second process of digestion requires
thorough and slow mastication. The formation of proper
chyle demands appropriate mastication and chymification;
while a healthy action of the lacteals requires that all the
anterior stages of the digestive process be as perfect as
possible. (<a href='#APPENDIX_F'>Appendix F.</a>)</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>273. <span class='smcap'>It</span> is a law of the system, that each organ is excited
to healthy and efficient action, when influenced by its appropriate
stimulus. Accordingly, nutrient food, that is adapted
to the wants of the system, imparts a healthy stimulation to
the salivary glands during the process of mastication. The
food that is well masticated, and has blended with it a <a name='TC_53'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'prope'">proper</ins>
amount of saliva, will induce a healthy action in the <a name='TC_54'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">stomach.</ins>
Well-prepared chyme is the natural stimulus of the <a name='TC_55'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added ','">duodenum,</ins>
liver, and pancreas; pure chyle is the appropriate excitant of
the lacteal vessels.</p>
<p>274. The perfection of the digestive process, as well as
the health of the general system, requires the observance of
certain conditions. These will be considered under four
heads:&mdash;1st. The <i>Quantity</i> of food that should be taken.
2d. Its <i>Quality</i>. 3d. The <i>Manner</i> in which it should be
taken. 4th. The <i>Condition</i> of the system when food is
taken.</p>
<p>275. The <span class='smcaplc'>QUANTITY</span> of food necessary for the system
varies. Age, occupation, temperament, temperature, habits,
amount of clothing, health and disease are among the circumstances
which produce the variation.</p>
<p class='box'>273&ndash;330. <i>Give the hygiene of the digestive organs.</i> 273. Give a law
of the system. What is the appropriate stimulus of the salivary glands
during mastication? Of the stomach? Of the duodenum? Of the
lacteal vessels? 274. What does the perfection of the digestive organs
require? 275. What exert an influence on the quantity of food necessary
for the system?</p>
<p>276. <i>The child and youth require food to promote the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
growth of the different parts of the body.</i> The more rapid
the growth of the child, the greater the demand for food.
This accounts for the keen appetite and vigorous digestion in
childhood. When the youth has attained his full growth, this
necessity for nutriment ceases; after this period of life, if the
same amount of food is taken, and there is no increase of
labor or exertion, the digestive apparatus will become diseased,
and the vigor of the whole system diminished.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the body has become emaciated from
want of nutriment, either from famine or disease, there is an
increased demand for food. This may be gratified with
impunity until the individual has regained the usual size, but
repletion should be avoided.</p>
<p>277. <i>Food is required to repair the waste, or loss of substance
that attends action.</i> In every department of nature,
waste, or loss of substance, attends and follows action. When
an individual increases his exercise,&mdash;changes from light to severe
labor,&mdash;or the inactive and sedentary undertake journeys
for pleasure, the fluids of the system circulate with increased
energy. The old and exhausted particles of matter are more
rapidly removed through the action of the vessels of the skin,
lungs, kidneys, and other organs, and their places are filled
with new atoms, deposited by the small blood-vessels.</p>
<p>278. As the chyle supplies the blood with the newly vitalized
particles of matter, there is, consequently, an increased
demand for food. This want of the system induces, in
general, a sensation of hunger or appetite, which may be
regarded as an indication of the general state of the body.
The sympathy that exists throughout the system accords to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the stomach the power of making known this state to the
nervous system, and, if the functions of this faithful monitor
have not been impaired by disease, abuse, or habit, the call is
imperious, and should be regarded.</p>
<p class='box'>276. At what age is the appetite keen and the digestion vigorous? Why?
What is said in regard to the quantity of food when the youth has attained
his growth? What exception, as given in the observation? 277. Give
another demand for food. What effect has increased exercise upon the
system? <a name='TC_56'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">278.</ins> How are the new particles of matter supplied? What does
this induce?</p>
<p>279. <i>When exercise or labor is lessened, the quantity of
food should be diminished.</i> When a person who has been
accustomed to active exercise, or even hard manual labor,
suddenly changes to an employment that demands less activity,
the waste attendant on action will be diminished in a corresponding
degree; hence the quantity of food should be
lessened in nearly the same proportion as the amount of
exercise is diminished. If this principle be disregarded, the
tone of the digestive organs will be impaired, and the health
of the system enfeebled.</p>
<p>280. This remark is applicable to those students who have
left laborious employments to attend school. Although the
health is firm, and the appetite keen from habit, yet every
pupil should practise some self-denial, and not eat as much as
the appetite craves, the first week of the session. After some
days, the real wants of the system will generally be manifested
by a corresponding sensation of hunger.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is a common observation that in academies
and colleges, the older students from the country, who have
been accustomed to hard manual labor, suffer more frequently
from defective digestion and impaired health than the younger
and feebler students from the larger towns and cities.</p>
<p>281. <i>Food is essential in maintaining a proper temperature
of the system.</i> The heat of the system, at least in part,
is produced in the minute vessels of the several organs, by the
union of oxygen with carbon and hydrogen, which the food
and drink contain. The amount of heat generated, is greatest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
when it is most rapidly removed from the system, which
occurs in cold weather. This is the cause of the system
requiring more food in winter than summer.</p>
<p class='box'>279. Why should the quantity of food be diminished when the exercise
is lessened? What effect if this principle be disregarded? 280. To what
class is this remark applicable? What is often observed among students
in academies and colleges? 281. State another demand for food. What is
one source of heat in the body?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Persons that do not have food sufficient for
the natural wants of the system, require more clothing than
those who are well fed.</p>
<p>282. The last-mentioned principle plainly indicates the
propriety and necessity of lessening the quantity of food as
the warm season approaches. Were this practised, the tone
of the stomach and the vigor of the system would continue
unimpaired, the &ldquo;season complaints&rdquo; would be avoided, and
the &ldquo;strengthening bitters&rdquo; would not be sought to create
an appetite.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Stable-keepers and herdsmen are aware of
the fact, that as the warm season commences, then animals
require less food. Instinct teaches these animals more truly,
in this particular, than man allows reason to guide him.</p>
<p>283. <i>The quantity of food should have reference to the
present condition of the digestive organs.</i> If they are weakened
or diseased, so that but a small quantity of food can be
properly digested or changed, that amount only should be
taken. Food does not invigorate the system, except it is
changed, as has been described in previous paragraphs.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When taking care of a sick child, the anxiety
of the mother and the sufferings of the child may induce her
to give food when it would be highly injurious. The attending
physician is the only proper person to direct what quantity
should be given.</p>
<p class='box'>Why do we eat more in the winter than in the summer? What practical
observation is given? 282. Why should the quantity of food be
lessened as warm weather commences? What would be avoided if this
principle were obeyed? 283. Why should the present condition of the
digestive organs be regarded in reference to the quantity of food? Mention
an instance in which it would be injudicious to give food.</p>
<p>284. <i>The quantity of food is modified, in some degree, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
habit.</i> A healthy person, whose exercise is in pure air, may
be accustomed to take more food than is necessary. The
useless excess is removed from the system by the waste outlets,
as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, &amp;c. In such cases,
if food is not taken in the usual quantity, there will be a feeling
of emptiness, if not of hunger, from the want of the usual
distention of the stomach. This condition of the digestive
organs may be the result of disease, but it is more frequently
produced by inordinate daily indulgence in eating, amounting
almost to gluttony.</p>
<p>285. <i>Large quantities of food oppress the stomach, and
cause general languor of the whole body.</i> This is produced
by the extra demands made on the system for an increased
supply of blood and nervous fluid to enable the stomach to
free itself of its burden. Thus, when we intend to make any
extraordinary effort, mental or physical, at least for one meal,
we should eat less food than usual, rather than a greater
quantity.</p>
<p>286. <i>No more food should be eaten than is barely sufficient
to satisfy the appetite.</i> Nor should appetite be confounded
with taste. The one is a natural desire for food to
supply the wants of the system; the other is an artificial
desire merely to gratify the palate.</p>
<p>287. Although many things may aid us in determining the
quantity of food proper for an individual, yet there is no
certain guide in all cases. It is maintained by some, that the
sensation of hunger or appetite is always an indication of the
want of food, while the absence of this peculiar sensation is
regarded as conclusive evidence that aliment is not demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
This assertion is not correct, as an appetite may be created
for food by condiments and gormandizing, which is as artificial
and as morbid as that which craves tobacco or ardent
spirits. On the other hand, a structural or functional disease
of the brain may prevent that organ from taking cognizance
of the sensations of the stomach, when the system actually
requires nourishment. Observation shows, that disease, habit,
the state of the mind, and other circumstances, exert an
influence on the appetite.</p>
<p class='box'>284. Show the effect of habit upon the quantity of food that is eaten.
What is said in regard to inordinate eating? 285. What is the effect of
eating large quantities of food? What suggestion when an extraordinary
effort, either mental or physical, is to be made? 286. How much food
should generally be eaten? 287. What is the assertion of some persons
relative to the quantity of food necessary for the system?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Dr. Beaumont noticed, in the experiments
upon Alexis St. Martin, that after a certain amount of food
was converted into chyme, the gastric juice ceased to ooze
from the coats of the stomach. Consequently, it has been
inferred by some writers on physiology, that the glands which
supply the gastric fluid, by a species of instinctive intelligence,
would only secrete enough fluid to convert into chyme the
aliment needed to supply the real wants of the system. What
are the reasons for this inference? There is no evidence that
the gastric glands possess instinctive intelligence, and can
there be a reason adduced, why they may not be stimulated
to extra functional action as well as other organs, and why
they may not also be influenced by habit?</p>
<p>288. While all agree that the remote or predisposing
cause of hunger is, usually, a demand of the system for
nutrient material, the proximate or immediate cause of the
sensation of hunger is not clearly understood. Some physiologists
suppose that it is produced by an engorged condition
of the glands of the stomach which supply the gastric juice;
while others maintain that it depends on a peculiar condition
of the nervous system.</p>
<p>289. The <span class='smcaplc'>QUALITY</span> of the food best adapted to the wants of
the system is modified by many circumstances. There are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
many varieties of food, and these are much modified by the
different methods of preparation. The same kind of food is
not equally well adapted to different individuals, or to the
same individual in all conditions; as vocation, health, exposure,
habits of life, season, climate, &amp;c., influence the condition of
the system.</p>
<p class='box'>What does observation show? 288. What is said of the causes of
hunger? 289. Why is not the same kind of food adapted to different
individuals?</p>
<p>290. All articles of food may be considered in two relations:
1st, As nutritive. 2d, As digestible. Substances are
nutritious in proportion to their capacity to yield the elements
of chyle, of which carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen
are the most essential; they are digestible in proportion to
the facility with which they are acted upon by the gastric
juice. These properties should not be confounded in the
various articles used for food.</p>
<p>291. As a &ldquo;living body has no power of forming elements,
or of converting one elementary substance into another, it
therefore follows that the elements of which the body of an
animal is composed must be in the food.&rdquo; (Chap. III.) Of
the essential constituents of the human body, carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen are the most important, because
they compose the principal part of the animal body; while
the other elements are found in very small proportions, and
many of them only in a few organs of the system. (<a href='#APPENDIX_G'>Appendix
G.</a>)</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Nitrogen renders food more stimulating, particularly
if combined with a large quantity of carbon, as beef.
Those articles that contain the greatest amount of the constituent
elements of the system are most nutritious. As milk
and eggs contain all the essential elements of the human system,
so they are adapted to almost universal use, and are
highly nutritious.</p>
<p class='box'>290. In what proportion are substances nutritious? Digestible? Why
does beef stimulate the system? What is said of milk and eggs?</p>
<p>292. The following table, by Pereira, in his treatise on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>

correct conclusions of the quantity of nutriment in different
kinds of food, and its adaptation to the wants of the system.</p>

of diet. This principle has been, and may be illustrated by
experiment. Feed a dog with pure sugar, or olive-oil, (articles
that contain no nitrogen,) for several weeks, and the evil
effects of non-nitrogenous nutriment will be manifested. At
first, the dog will take his food with avidity, and seem to
thrive upon it; soon this desire for food will diminish, his
body emaciate, his eye become ulcerated, and in a few weeks
he will die; but mix bran or sawdust with the sugar or oil,
and the health and vigor of the animal will be maintained for
months. A similar phenomenon will be manifested, if grain
only be given to a horse, without hay, straw, or material of
like character. (<a href='#APPENDIX_H'>Appendix H.</a>)</p>
<p>294. Some articles of food contain the elements of chyle
in great abundance, yet afford but little nutriment, because
they are difficult of digestion; while other articles contain but
a small quantity of these elements, and afford more nourishment,
because they are more easily affected by the digestive
process.</p>
<p class='box'>293. How has the effect of non-nitrogenous nutriment been illustrated?
294. Why do some articles of food that contain the elements of chyle afford
but little nutriment? Why do articles that contain a small quantity of these
elements afford more nourishment? 295. How was the time required for
digesting different articles of food ascertained?</p>
<p>295. The following table exhibits the general results of
experiments made on Alexis St. Martin, by Dr. Beaumont,
when he endeavored to ascertain the time required for the
digestion of different articles of food.<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> The stomach of St.
Martin was ruptured by the bursting of a gun. When he
recovered from the effects of the accident under the surgical
care of Dr. Beaumont, the stomach became adherent to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
side, with an external aperture. Nature had formed a kind
of valve, which closed the aperture from the interior, and thus
prevented the contents of the stomach from escaping; but
on pushing it aside, the process of digestion could be seen.
Through this opening, the appearance of the coats of the stomach
and food, at different stages of digestion, were examined.</p>

</table></div>
<p>296. In view of this table, the question may be suggested,
Is that article of food most appropriate to the system which is
most easily and speedily digested? To this it may be replied,
that the stomach is subject to the same law as the muscles
and other organs; exercise, within certain limits, strengthens
it. If, therefore, we always eat those articles most easily
digested, the digestive powers will be weakened; if over-worked,
they will be exhausted. Hence the kind and amount
of food should be adapted to the maintenance of the digestive
powers, and to their gradual invigoration when debilitated.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Food that is most easily digested is not always
most appropriate to a person convalescing from disease.
If the substance passes rapidly through the digestive process,
it may induce a recurrence of the disease. Thus the simple
preparations which are not stimulating, as water-gruel, are
better for a sick person than the more digestible beef and fish.</p>
<p>297. The question is not well settled, whether animal or
vegetable food is best adapted to nourish man. There are
nations, particularly in the torrid zone, that subsist, exclusively,
on vegetables; while those of the frigid zone feed on fish or
animal food. In the temperate zone, among civilized nations,
a mixed diet is almost universal. When we consider the
organization of the human system, the form and arrangement
of the teeth, the structure of the stomach and intestines, we
are led to conclude, that both animal and vegetable food is
requisite, and that a mixed diet is most conducive to strength,
health, and long life.</p>
<p class='box'>296. How is the question answered, whether that article is most appropriate
to the system which is most easily digested? Give observation.
297. What is said of the adaptation of animal and vegetable food to man?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>298. <i>The food should be adapted to the distensible character
of the stomach and alimentary canal.</i> The former will be
full, if it contain only a gill; it may be so distended as to
contain a quart. The same is true of the intestines. If the
food is concentrated, or contains the quantity of nutriment
which the system requires, in small bulk, the stomach and
intestines will need the stimulation of distention and friction,
which is consequent upon the introduction and transit of the
innutritious material into and through the alimentary canal.
If the food is deficient in innutritious matter, the tendency
is, to produce an inactive and diseased condition of the digestive
organs. For this reason, nutrient food should have blended
with it innutritious material. Unbolted wheat bread is
more healthy than hot flour cakes; ripe fruits and vegetables
than rich pies, or jellies.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> 1st. The observance of this rule is of more
importance to students, sedentary mechanics, and those individuals
whose digestive apparatus has been enfeebled, than to
those of active habits and firm health.</p>
<p>2d. The circumstance that different articles of food contain
different proportions of waste, or innutritious matter, may be
made practically subservient in the following way: If, at any
particular season of the year, there is a tendency to a diarrh&oelig;a,
an article that contains a small proportion of waste should be
selected for food; but, if there is a tendency to an inactive
or costive condition of the intestinal canal, such kinds of food
should be used as contain the greatest proportion of waste, as
such articles are most stimulating to the digestive organs, and,
consequently, most laxative.</p>
<p>299. <i>In the selection of food, the influence of season and
climate should be considered.</i> Food of a highly stimulating
character may be used almost with impunity during the cold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
weather of a cold climate; but in the warm season, and in a
warm climate, it would be very deleterious. Animal food,
being more stimulating than vegetable, can be eaten in the
winter but vegetable food should be used more freely in the
spring and summer.</p>
<p class='box'>298. What is said of the distensible character of the stomach and alimentary
canal? What is the effect of eating highly concentrated food? Why is
the unbolted wheat bread more healthy than flour cakes? Give observation 1st.
Observation 2d. 299. What kind of food is adapted to cold weather? To
warm weather?</p>
<p>300. <i>The influence of food on the system is modified by
the age of the individual.</i> The organs of a child are more
sensitive and excitable than those of a person advanced in
years. Therefore a vegetable diet would be most appropriate
for a child, while stimulating animal food might be conducive
to the health of a person advanced in life.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the digestive organs are highly
impressible or diseased, it is very important to adopt a
nutritious, unstimulating, vegetable diet, as soon as the warm
season commences.</p>
<p>301. <i>Habit is another strong modifying influence.</i> If a
person has been accustomed to an animal or vegetable diet,
and there is a sudden change from one to the other, a diseased
condition of the system, particularly of the digestive apparatus,
usually follows. When it is necessary to change our manner
of living, it should be done gradually.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>302. <i>Some temperaments require more stimulating food
than others.</i> As a general rule, those persons whose sensations
are comparatively obtuse, and movements slow, will be
benefited by animal food; while those individuals whose
constitutions are highly impressible, and whose movements
are quick and hurried, require a nutritious and unstimulating
vegetable diet.</p>
<p class='box'>300. What kinds of food are appropriate to old age? Why? What
kinds to childhood? Why? 301. What is the effect when there is a
sudden change from a vegetable to an animal diet? How should all
changes of the system be made? 302. Do different temperaments require
different kinds of food? What general rule is given?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS, CONTINUED.</h3>
</div>
<p>303. The <span class='smcaplc'>MANNER</span> in which food should be taken is of much
practical importance; upon it the health of the digestive organs
measurably depends. But few circumstances modify the
proper manner of taking food, or should exercise any controlling
influence.</p>
<p>304. <i>Food should be taken at regular periods.</i> The interval
between meals should be regulated by the character of the
food, the age, health, exercise, and habits of the individual.
The digestive process is more energetic and rapid in the
young, active, and vigorous, than in the aged, indolent, and
feeble; consequently, food should be taken more frequently
by the former than by the latter class.</p>
<p>305. In some young and vigorous persons, food may be
digested in one hour; in other persons, it may require four
hours or more. The average time, however, to digest an ordinary
meal, will be from two to four hours. In all instances,
the stomach will require from one to three hours to recruit
its exhausted powers after the labor of digesting a meal
before it will again enter upon the vigorous performance of
its duties.</p>
<p>306. <i>Food should not be taken too frequently.</i> If food is
taken before the stomach has regained its tone and energy by
repose, the secretion of the gastric juice, and the contraction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
of the muscular fibres, will be imperfect. Again, if food is
taken before the digestion of the preceding meal has been
completed, the effects will be still worse, because the food
partially digested becomes mixed with that last taken. <a name='TC_57'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'There fore' over line break.">Therefore</ins>
the interval between each meal should be long enough
for the whole quantity to be digested, and the time of repose
should be sufficient to recruit the exhausted organs. The
feebler the person and the more debilitated the stomach, the
more important to observe the above directions.</p>
<p class='box'>303. Why is it important that we regard the manner of taking our food?
304. How should the intervals between meals be regulated? 305. What is
the average time required to digest an ordinary meal? 306. Why should
not food be taken too frequently?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the feeding of infants, as well as in
supplying food to older children, the preceding suggestions
should always be regarded. The person who has been confined
by an exhausting sickness, should most scrupulously
regard this rule, if he wishes to regain his strength and flesh
with rapidity. As the rapidity of the digestive process is less
in students and individuals who are engaged in sedentary
employments, than in stirring agriculturists, the former class
are more liable to take food too frequently than the latter,
while its observance is of greater importance to the sedentary
artisan than to the lively lad and active farmer.</p>
<p>307. <i>Food should be well masticated.</i> All solid aliments
should be reduced to a state of comparative fineness, by the
teeth, before it is swallowed; the gastric fluid of the stomach
will then blend with it more readily, and act more vigorously
in reducing it to chyme. The practice of swallowing solid
food, slightly masticated, or &ldquo;bolting&rdquo; it down, tends to
derange the digestive process and impair the nutrition of the
system.</p>
<p>308. <i>Mastication should be moderate, not rapid.</i> In masticating
food, the salivary glands are excited to action, and
some time must elapse before they can, secrete saliva in sufficient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
quantities to moisten it. If the aliment is not supplied
with saliva, digestion is retarded; besides, in rapid eating,
more food is generally consumed than the system demands,
or can be easily digested. Laborers, as well as men of leisure,
should have ample time for taking their meals. Imperfect
mastication is a prevailing cause of indigestion.</p>
<p class='box'>What persons would be benefited by observing the preceding remarks?
307. Why should food be well masticated? What is the effect
of &ldquo;bolting down&rdquo; food? 308. How should mastication be performed?
Why?</p>
<p>309. <i>Food should be masticated and swallowed without
drink.</i> As the salivary glands supply fluid to moisten the dry
food, the use of tea, coffee, water, or any other fluid, is not
demanded by nature&rsquo;s laws while taking a meal. One objection
to &ldquo;washing down&rdquo; the food with drink is, the aliment
is moistened, not with the saliva, but with the drink. This
tends to induce disease, not only in the salivary organs, by
leaving them in a state of comparative inactivity, but in
the stomach, by the deficiency of the salivary stimulus.
Another is, large quantities of fluids, used as drinks, give
undue distention to the stomach, and lessen the energy of the
gastric juice by its dilution, thus retarding digestion. Again,
drinks taken into the stomach must be removed by absorption
before the digestion of other articles is commenced.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Were it customary not to place drinks on the
table until the solid food is eaten, the evil arising from drinking
too much at meals would be obviated. The horse is never
known to leave his provender, nor the ox his blade of grass, to
wash it down; but many persons, from habit rather than thirst,
drink largely during meals.</p>
<p>310. The peculiar sensation in the mouth and fauces, called
thirst, may not always arise from the demand for fluids to
increase the <i>serum</i> (water) of the blood, as in the desire for
drink attendant on free perspiration, for then, pure water or
some diluent drink is absolutely necessary; but it may be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
result of fever, or local disease of the parts connected with
the throat. In many instances, thirst may be allayed by chewing
some hard substance, as a dry cracker. This excites a
secretion from the salivary glands, which removes the disagreeable
sensation. In thirst, attendant on a heated condition
of the system, this practice affords relief, and is safe; while
the practice of drinking large quantities of cold fluids, is
unsafe, and should never be indulged.</p>
<p class='box'>Why should all persons have ample time for eating? 309. Why are
drinks not necessary while masticating food? Give the objections to
&ldquo;washing down&rdquo; food. What observation relative to drink? 310. Does
the sensation of thirst always arise from a real want of the system?</p>
<p>311. <i>Food or drink should not be taken when very hot.</i>
When food or drink is taken hot, the vessels of the mucous
membrane of the gums, mouth, and stomach are unduly stimulated
for a short time; and this is followed by reaction,
attended by a loss of tone, and debility of these parts. This
practice is a fruitful cause of spongy gums, decayed teeth,
sore mouth, and indigestion.</p>
<p>312. <i>Food or drink should not be taken very cold.</i> If
a considerable quantity of very cold food or liquid be taken
immediately into the stomach, the health will be endangered,
and the tone of the system will be impaired, from the sudden
abstraction of heat from the coats of the stomach, and
from surrounding organs, to impart warmth to the cold food
or drink. This arrests the digestive process, and the food is
retained in the stomach too long, and causes oppression and
irritation. Consequently, food and drink that are moderately
heated are best adapted to the natural condition of the digestive
apparatus.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Food of an injurious quality, or taken in an
improper manner, affects the inferior animals as well as man.
The teeth of cows that are closely penned in cities, and are
fed on distillery slops, or the unhealthy slops and remnants
of kitchens, decay and fall out in about two years. Can the
milk of such diseased animals be healthy&mdash;the proper nourishment
for children?</p>
<p class='box'>Give instances when it does and when it does not. 311. Why should not
food or drink be taken hot? 312. Why should they not be taken cold?
Show some of the effects of improper food upon the inferior <a name='TC_58'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">animals.</ins></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>313. The <span class='smcaplc'>CONDITION</span> of the system should be regarded when
food is taken. This is necessary, as the present and ulterior
condition of the digestive apparatus is strongly influenced by
the state of the other organs of the system.</p>
<p>314. <i>Food should not be taken immediately after severe
exertion, either of the body or mind.</i> For all organs in
action require and receive more blood and nervous fluid, than
when at rest. This is true of the brain, muscles, and vocal
organs, when they have been actively exercised. The
increased amount of fluid, both sanguineous and nervous,
supplied to any organ during extra functional action, is abstracted
from other parts of the system. This enfeebles and
prostrates the parts that supply the blood and nervous fluid to
the active organ. Again, when any organ has been in vigorous
action for a few hours, some time will elapse before the
increased action of the arteries and nerves abates, and a due
supply of fluids is transmitted to other organs, or an equilibrium
of action in the system is re&euml;stablished.</p>
<p>315. Thus food should not be taken immediately after
severe mental labor, protracted speaking, continued singing,
or laborious manual toil; as the digestive organs will be in a
state of comparative debility, and consequently unfit to digest
food. From thirty to sixty minutes should elapse, after the
cessation of severe employment, before food is taken. This
time may be spent in cheerful amusement or social conversation.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The practice of students and accountants
going immediately from severe mental labor to their meals,
is a pernicious one, and a fruitful cause of indigestion and
mental debility. The custom of farmers and mechanics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
hurrying from their toil to the dinner-table, does much to
cause dyspepsia and debility among these classes in community.</p>
<p class='box'>313. Should the condition of the system be regarded in taking food?
314. When should food not be taken? Why? What is the result when
an organ has been in vigorous action? 315. After the cessation of severe
toil, how much time should expire before eating? What is one cause of
indigestion among students and accountants?</p>
<p>316. <i>Severe mental or manual toil should not be entered
upon immediately after eating.</i> As there is an increased
amount of blood and nervous fluid supplied to the stomach
and alimentary canal during the digestion of food, a deficiency
exists in other organs. This is evinced by a slight paleness
of the skin, and a disinclination to active thought and exercise.
Under such circumstances, if either the mind, vocal organs,
or muscles are called into energetic action, there will be an
abstraction of the necessary amount of blood and nervous
fluid from the stomach, and the process of digestion
will be arrested. This will not only cause disease of the
digestive organs, but chyle will not be formed, to nourish the
system.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> An English gentleman fed two dogs upon
similar articles of food. He permitted one to remain quiet in
a dark room; the other he sent in pursuit of game. At the
expiration of one hour, he had both killed. The stomach of
the dog that had remained quiet was nearly empty. The
food had been properly changed and carried forward into the
alimentary canal. In the stomach of the dog that had used
his muscles in chasing game, the aliment remained nearly
unaltered.</p>
<p>317. The same principle may be applied to the action of
the organs of man. If his mind or muscles act intensely
soon after eating, the stomach will not be sufficiently stimulated
by blood and nervous fluid to change the food in a
suitable period. The Spanish practice of having a &ldquo;siesta,&rdquo;
or sleep after dinner, is far better than the custom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Anglo-Saxon race, who hurry from their meals to the field,
shop, or study, in order to save time, which, in too many
instances, is lost by a sense of oppression and suffering which
soon follows.</p>
<p class='box'>316. Why should not severe manual or mental exertion be made immediately
after eating? State the illustration. 317. May this principle be
applied to the action of the human stomach? What is said of the Spanish
custom of resting after dinner?</p>
<p>318. In some instances of good health, the infringement of
this organic law may seem to pass with impunity, but Nature,
though lenient, sooner or later asserts her claims. The practice
of the Spaniard may be improved by indulging, for an
hour before resuming toil, in moderate exercise of the muscular
system, conjoined with agreeable conversation and a
hearty laugh, as this facilitates digestion, and tends to &ldquo;shake
the cobwebs from the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> No judicious teamster drives his animals as
soon as they have swallowed their food, but gives them a
period for repose, so that their food may be digested, and
their systems invigorated. In this way, he secures the greatest
amount of labor from his team.</p>
<p>319. <i>The mind exerts an influence upon the digestive process.</i>
This is clearly exhibited, when an individual receives
intelligence of the loss of a friend or of property. He
may at the time be sitting before a plentiful board, with a
keen appetite; but the unexpected news destroys it, because
the excited brain withholds its stimulus. This shows the propriety
of avoiding absorbing topics of thought at meals, as
labored discussions and matters of business; but substitute
cheerful and light conversation, enlivening wit, humor, the
social intercourse of family and friends; these keep the brain
in action, but not in toil. Under such circumstances, the
blood and nervous fluid flow freely, the work of digestion is
readily commenced, and easily carried on.</p>
<p>320. <i>Indigestion arising from a prostration of the nervous
system, should be treated with great care.</i> The food should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
be simple, nutritious, moderate in quantity, and taken at regular
periods. Large quantities of stimulating food, frequently
taken, serve to increase the nervous prostration. Those
afflicted should exercise in the open air, and engage in social
conversation, that the brain may be excited to a natural or
healthy action, in order that it may impart to the digestive
organs the necessary stimulation.</p>
<p class='box'>Of the Anglo-Saxon race? 318. How can the Spanish custom be improved?
319. How is the influence of the mind on the digestive process
exhibited? What does it show the necessity of avoiding? 320. How
should indigestion arising from nervous prostration be treated?</p>
<p>321. <i>Persons should abstain from eating, at least three
hours before retiring for sleep.</i> It is no unusual occurrence,
for those persons who have eaten heartily immediately before
retiring to sleep, to have unpleasant dreams, or to be aroused
from their unquiet slumber by colic pains. In such instances,
the brain becomes partially dormant, and does not
impart to the digestive organs the requisite amount of nervous
influence. The nervous stimulus being deficient, the unchanged
food remains in the stomach, causing irritation of this organ.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A healthy farmer, who was in the habit of
eating one fourth of a mince pie immediately before going to
bed, became annoyed with unpleasant dreams, and, among the
varied images of his fancy, he saw that of his deceased father.
Becoming alarmed, he consulted a physician, who, after a
patient hearing of the case, gravely advised him to eat <i>half</i> of
a mince pie, assuring him that he would then see his grandfather.</p>
<p>322. <i>When the general system and digestive organs are
enfeebled, mild, unstimulating food, in small quantities, should
be given.</i> In the instance of a shipwrecked and famished
mariner, or a patient recovering from disease, but a small
quantity of nourishment should be given at a time. The reason
for this, is, that when the stomach is weakened from want
of nourishment, it is as unfitted for a long period of action in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
digesting food, as the muscles are, under like circumstances,
for walking. Consequently, knowledge and prudence should
direct the administration of food under these circumstances.
The popular adage, that &ldquo;food never does harm when there
is a desire for it,&rdquo; is untrue, and, if practically adopted, may
be injurious and destructive to life.</p>
<p class='box'>321. What is the effect of eating immediately before retiring for sleep?
How is this illustrated in the case of a healthy farmer? 322. How should
the food be given when both the digestive organs and general system are
debilitated? Give the reason.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Liquids are rapidly removed from the stomach
by absorption. Hence, in cases of great prostration,
when it is desirable to introduce nutriment into the system,
without delay, the animal and vegetable broths are a desirable
and convenient form of supplying aliment.</p>
<p>323. <i>The condition of the skin exercises an important influence
on the digestive apparatus.</i> Let free perspiration be
checked, either from uncleanliness or from chills, and it will
diminish the functional action of the stomach and its associated
organs. This is one of the fruitful causes of the
&ldquo;liver and stomach complaints&rdquo; among the half-clothed and
filthy population of the crowded cities and villages of our
country. Attention to clothing and bathing would likewise
prevent many of the diseases of the alimentary canal, called
&ldquo;season complaints,&rdquo; particularly among children.</p>
<p>324. <i>Restricting the movements of the ribs and diaphragm
impairs digestion.</i> At each full inspiration, the ribs are
elevated, and the central portion of the diaphragm is depressed,
from one to two inches. This depression is accompanied by a
relaxation of the anterior abdominal walls. At each act of
expiration, the relaxed abdominal muscles contract, the ribs
are depressed, the diaphragm relaxes, and its central parts
ascend. These movements of the midriff cause the elevation
and depression of the stomach, liver, and other abdominal
organs, which is a natural stimulus of these parts.</p>
<p class='box'>In cases of great prostration, what is recommended? 323. How is
the influence that the skin exercises on the digestive organs illustrated?
324. What effect on the digestive process has the restriction of the ribs
and diaphragm?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>325. It is noted of individuals who restrain the free movements
of the abdominal muscles by tight dresses, that the tone
and vigor of the digestive organs are diminished. The
restricted waist will not admit of a full and deep inspiration
and so essential is this to health, that abuse in this respect
soon enfeebles and destroys the functions of the system.</p>
<p>326. <i>Pure air is necessary to give a keen appetite and
vigorous digestion.</i> The digestive organs not only need the
stimulus of blood, but they absolutely need the influence of
pure blood, which cannot exist in the system, except when we
breathe a pure air. From this we learn why those persons
who sleep in small, ill ventilated rooms, have little or no
appetite in the morning, and why the mouth and throat are so
dry and disagreeable. The effect of impure blood, in diminishing
the desire for food, and enfeebling the digestive organs,
is well illustrated by the following incidents.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. Dr. Reid, in his work on &ldquo;Ventilation
of Rooms,&rdquo; relates that an innkeeper in London, when he
provided a public dinner, always spread his tables in an
under-ground room, with low walls, where the air was confined
and impure. He assigned as a reason for so doing, that
his guests consumed only one third as much food and wine,
as if the tables were laid in the open air.</p>
<p>2d. A manufacturer stated before a committee of the
British Parliament, that he had removed an arrangement for
ventilating his mill, because he noticed that his men ate much
more after his mill was ventilated, than previous to admitting
fresh air into the rooms, and that he could not <i>afford</i> to have
them breathe pure air.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Many of the cases of indigestion among
clergymen, seamstresses, school teachers, sedentary mechanics,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and factory operatives, are produced by breathing
the impure air of the rooms they occupy. These cases can
be prevented, as well as cured, by proper attention to
ventilation.</p>
<p class='box'>325. What is observed of those individuals that restrict the movements
of the abdominal muscles? 326. Why is pure air necessary to vigorous
digestion? Give illustration 1st. Illustration 2d. What is one cause of
indigestion among the sedentary class in community?</p>
<p>327. <i>The position of a person, in standing or sitting,
exerts an influence upon the digestive organs.</i> If a person
lean, or stoop forward, the distance between the pelvic bones
and the diaphragm is diminished. This prevents the depression
of the diaphragm, while the stomach, liver, pancreas,
and other abdominal organs, suffer compression, which induces
many severe diseases of these organs. As healthy and well-developed
muscles keep the spinal column in an erect position,
which conduces to the health of the organs of digestion, the
child should be taught to avoid all positions <i>but the erect</i>, while
studying or walking. This position, combined with unrestricted
waists, will do much to remove the now prevalent
disease, dyspepsia.</p>
<p>328. <i>Whatever kind of aliment is taken, it is separated
into nutriment and residuum</i>; the former of which is conveyed,
through the medium of the circulation, to all organs
of the system, and the latter, if not expelled, accumulates,
causing headache and dizziness, with a general uneasiness;
and, if allowed to continue, it lays the foundation of a long
period of suffering and disease. For the preservation of
health, it is necessary that there should be a daily evacuation
of the residual matter.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In chronic diseases of the digestive organs,
very frequently, there is an inactive, or costive condition of
the alimentary canal. This may be removed in many cases,
and relieved in all instances, by friction over the abdominal
organs, and by making an effort at some stated period each
day, (evening is best,) to evacuate the residuum. In acute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
diseases, as fever, regard should be given to regularity in relieving
the intestines of residuum. Attention to this suggestion
will in many instances obviate the necessity of cathartic
medicine.</p>
<p class='box'><a name='TC_59'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">327.</ins> Why does the position of a person affect digestion? 328. Into
what are different kinds of aliment separated?</p>
<p>329. We would add, for the benefit of those afflicted with
hemorrhoids, or piles, that the best time for evacuating the
intestinal canal would be immediately before retiring for the
night. During the night, while recumbent, the protruding
parts return to their proper place, and the surrounding organs
acquire increased tone to retain them. The same observance
will do much to prevent such prostrating diseases.<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a></p>
<p>330. To recapitulate: digestion is most perfect when the
action of the cutaneous vessels is energetic; the brain and
vocal organs moderately stimulated by animated conversation;
the blood well purified; the muscular system duly
exercised; the food of an appropriate quality, taken in proper
quantities, at regular periods, and also properly masticated.</p>
<p class='box'>330. Give the summary when digestion is most perfect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VXII.</h2>
<h3>THE CIRCULATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>331. <span class='smcap'>The</span> ultimate object of the food and drink introduced
into the body, is to furnish material to promote the growth
and repair the waste of the organs of the system. The formation
of chyle (the nutrient portion of the food) has been
traced through the digestive process, and its transfer into the
vein at the lower part of the neck, from which it is conveyed
to the heart; and, finally, in the lungs it assimilates to the
character of blood.</p>
<p>332. The <span class='smcaplc'>BLOOD</span>, after standing a short time, when drawn
from its vessels, separates into <i>se&acute;rum</i>, (a watery fluid,) and
<i>co-ag&acute;u-lum</i>, (clot.) This fluid is distributed to every part of
the system. There is no part so minute that it does not
receive blood. The organs by which this distribution is
effected are so connected that there is properly neither beginning
nor end; but as it respects their functions, they are connected
in a complete circle. From this circumstance, they
are called the <i>Circulatory Organs</i>.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE CIRCULATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>333. The <span class='smcaplc'>CIRCULATORY ORGANS</span> are the <i>Heart</i>, <a name='TC_60'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added ','"><i>Ar&acute;te-ries</i>,</ins>
<i>Veins</i>, and <i>Cap&acute;il-la-ries</i>.</p>
<p>334. The <span class='smcaplc'>HEART</span> is placed obliquely, in the left cavity of
the chest, between the right and left lung. Its general form
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
is that of an inverted cone, the base of which is directed
upward and backward, toward the right shoulder, while its
apex points forward to the left side, about three inches from
the sternum to the space between the fifth and sixth ribs. Its
under side rests upon the tendinous portion of the diaphragm.
The heart is surrounded by a sac, called the <i>per-i-car&acute;di-um</i>,
(heart-case.) The interior surface of this membrane secretes
a watery fluid, that lubricates the exterior of the heart, and
obviates friction between it and the pericardium.</p>
<p class='box'>331. what is the ultimate object of the food? 332. Of what is the blood

<p class='box'>With what is it surrounded? What is its use? How much fluid does
this membrane contain when healthy?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In health, there is usually about a tea-spoonful
of fluid in the pericardium. When these parts are diseased,
it may be thrown out more abundantly, and sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
amounts to several ounces, producing a disease called dropsy
of the heart. But all the unpleasant sensations in the region
of the heart are not caused by an increased amount of fluid in
the pericardium, as this disease is not of frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>335. The heart is composed of muscular fibres, that
traverse it in different directions, some longitudinally, but
most of them in a spiral direction. The human heart is a
double organ, or it has two sides, called the right and the left.
The compartments of the two sides are separated by a muscular
<i>sep&acute;tum</i>, or partition. Again, each side of the heart is
divided into two parts, called the <i>Au&acute;ri-cle</i> (deaf ear) and the
<i>Ven&acute;tri-cle</i>.</p>

<p>336. The <span class='smcaplc'>AURICLES</span> differ in muscularity from the ventricles.
Their walls are thinner, and of a bluish color. These
cavities are a kind of reservoir, designed to contain the blood
arriving by the veins.</p>
<p>337. The <span class='smcaplc'>VENTRICLES</span> not only have their walls thicker
than the auricles, but they differ in their internal structure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
From the interior of these cavities arise fleshy columns, called
<i>co-lum&acute;n&aelig; car&acute;ne-&aelig;</i>. The walls of the left ventricle are thicker
and stronger than those of the right.</p>
<p class='box'>335. Of what is the heart composed? Give its divisions. 336. Describe
the auricles. 337. Describe the ventricles.</p>
<p>338. The cavities in the right side of the heart are triangular
in shape; those of the left, oval. Each cavity will contain
about two ounces of blood. Between the auricle and
ventricle in the right side of the heart, there are three folds,
or doublings, of thin, triangular membrane, called the <i>tri-cus&acute;pid</i>
valves. Between the auricle and ventricle in the left side,
there are two valves, called the <i>mi&acute;tral</i>. There are seen passing
from the floating edge of these valves to the column&aelig;
carne&aelig;, small white cords, called <i>chor&acute;d&aelig; ten&acute;di-n&aelig;</i>, which
prevent the floating edge of the valve from being carried into
the auricle.</p>
<p>339. The right ventricle of the heart gives rise to the <i>Pul&acute;mo-na-ry</i>
artery; the left ventricle, to a large artery called
the <i>A-ort&acute;a</i>. At the commencement of each of these arteries
there are three folds of membrane, and from their shape, they
are called <i>sem-i-lu&acute;nar</i> valves.</p>
<p>340. The heart is supplied with arteries and veins, which
ramify between its muscular fibres, through which its <i>nutrient</i>
blood passes. It has, likewise, a few lymphatics, and many
small nervous filaments from the sympathetic system of nerves.
This organ, in its natural state, exhibits but slight indications
of sensibility, and although nearly destitute of the sensation of
touch, it is yet, however, instantly affected by every painful
bodily excitement, or strong mental emotions.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> To obtain a clear idea of the heart and its
valves, it is recommended to examine this part of an ox or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
calf. In order that each ventricle be opened without mutilating
the fleshy columns, tendinous cords, and valves, cut on
each side of the septum parallel to it. This may be easily
found between the ventricles, as they differ in thickness.</p>
<p class='box'>338. How do the cavities in the heart differ? What is found between
the auricle and ventricle in the right side of the heart? How many valves
in the left side, and their names? Where are the tendinous cords, and
what is their use? 339. What vessels proceed from the ventricles? What
is said of their valves? 340. With what is the heart supplied? What is
said of its sensibility? How can an idea of the structure of the heart be
obtained?</p>
<p>341. The <span class='smcaplc'>ARTERIES</span> are the cylindrical tubes that convey
the blood from the heart to every part of the system. They
are dense in structure, and preserve, for the most part, the
cylindrical form, when emptied of their blood, which is their
condition after death.</p>
<p>342. The arteries are composed of three coats. The
external, or cellular coat, is firm and strong; the middle, or
fibrous coat, is composed of yellowish fibres. This coat is
elastic, fragile, and thicker than the external coat. Its elasticity
enables the vessel to accommodate itself to the quantity
of blood it may contain. The internal coat is a thin, serous
membrane, which lines the interior of the artery, and gives
it the smooth polish which that surface presents. It is continuous
with the lining membrane of the heart.</p>
<p>343. Communications between arteries are free and numerous.
They increase in frequency with diminution in
the size of the branches, so that through the medium of the
minute ramifications, the entire body may be considered as
one circle of inosculation. The arteries, in their distribution
through the body, are enclosed in a loose, cellular investment,
called a sheath, which separates them from the surrounding
tissues.</p>
<p>344. The <span class='smcaplc'>PULMONARY ARTERY</span> commences in front of the
origin of the aorta. It ascends obliquely to the under surface
of the arch of the aorta, where it divides into two branches,
one of which passes to the right, the other to the left lung.
These divide and subdivide in the structure of the lungs, and
terminate in the capillary vessels, which form a net-work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
around the air-cells, and become continuous with the minute
branches of the pulmonary veins. This artery conveys the
impure blood to the lungs, and, with its corresponding veins,
establishes the <i>lesser</i>, or <i>pulmonic circulation</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>345. The <span class='smcaplc'>AORTA</span> proceeds from the left ventricle of the
heart, and contains the pure, or nutrient blood. This trunk
gives off branches, which divide and subdivide to their ultimate
ramifications, constituting the great arterial tree which
pervades, by its minute subdivisions, every part of the animal
frame. This great artery and its divisions, with their returning
veins, constitute the <i>greater</i>, or <i>systemic circulation</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>346. The <span class='smcaplc'>VEINS</span> are the vessels which return the blood to
the auricles of the heart, after it has been circulated by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
arteries through the various tissues of the body. They are
thinner and more delicate in structure than the arteries, so
that when emptied of their blood, they become flattened and
collapsed. The veins commence by minute radicles in the
capillaries, which are every where distributed through the
textures of the body, and coalesce to constitute larger and
larger branches, till they terminate in the large trunks which
convey the dark-colored blood directly to the heart. In diameter
they are much larger than the arteries, and, like those
vessels, their combined area would constitute an imaginary
cone, the apex of which is placed at the heart, and the base
at the surface of the body.</p>
<p class='box'>What does fig.&nbsp;70 represent? 346. What are the veins?</p>
<p>347. The communications between the veins are more
frequent than between the arteries, and take place between
the larger as well as among the smaller vessels. The office of
these inosculations is very apparent, as tending to obviate the
obstructions to which the veins are peculiarly liable, from the
thinness of their coats, and from inability to overcome great
impediments by the force of their current. These tubes, as
well as the arteries, are supplied with nutrient vessels, and it
is to be presumed that nervous filaments from the sympathetic
nerves are distributed to their coats.</p>
<p>348. The external, or cellular coat of the veins, is dense
and firm, resembling the cellular tunic of the arteries. The
middle coat is fibrous, like that of the arteries, but extremely
thin. The internal coat is serous, and also similar to that of
the arteries. It is continuous with the lining membrane of the
heart at one extremity, and with the lining membrane of the
capillaries at the other.</p>
<p>349. At certain intervals, the internal coat forms folds, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
duplicatures, which constitute valves. They are generally composed
of two semilunar folds, one on each side of the vessel.
The free extremity of the valvular folds is concave, and
directed forward, so that while the current of blood sets toward
the heart, they present no impediment to its free passage; but
let the current become retrograde, and it is impeded by their
distention. The valves are most numerous in the veins of the
extremities, particularly the deeper veins situated between the
muscles; but in some of the larger trunks, and also in some
of the smaller veins, no valves exist.</p>

and are so distributed through every part of the body as to
render it impossible to introduce the smallest needle beneath
the skin, without wounding several of these fine vessels.
They are remarkable for the uniformity of diameter, and for
the constant divisions and communications which take place
between them.</p>
<p>351. The capillaries inosculate, on the one hand, with the
terminal extremity of the arteries, and on the other, with the
commencement of the veins. They establish the communication
between the termination of the arteries and the beginning
of the veins. The important operations of secretion
and the conversion of the nutrient materials of the blood into
bone, muscle, &amp;c., are performed in these vessels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE CIRCULATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>352. <span class='smcap'>The</span> walls of all the cavities of the heart are composed
of muscular fibres, which are endowed with the
property of contracting and relaxing, like the muscles of the
extremities. The contraction and relaxation of the muscular
tissue of the heart, produce a diminution and enlargement
of both auricular and ventricular cavities. The
auricles contract and dilate simultaneously, and so do the
ventricles; yet the contraction and dilatation of the auricles do
not alternate with the contraction and dilatation of the ventricles,
as the dilatation of the one is not completed before the
contraction of the other commences. The dilatation of the
ventricles is termed the <i>di-as&acute;to-le</i> of the heart; their contraction,
its <i>sys&acute;to-le</i>.</p>
<p>353. The ventricles contract quicker and more forcibly
than the auricles, and they are three times longer in dilating
than contracting. The walls of the right ventricle, being
thinner than the left, are more distensible, and thus this cavity
will contain a greater amount of blood. This arrangement
adapts it to the venous system, which is more capacious than
the arterial. The thicker and more powerful walls of the
left ventricle adapt it to expel the blood to a greater distance.</p>
<p>354. The valves in the heart permit the blood to flow from
the auricles to the ventricles, but prevent its reflowing. The
valves at the commencement of the aorta and pulmonary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
artery, permit the blood to flow from the ventricles into these
vessels, but prevent its returning.</p>
<p class='box'>352&ndash;366. <i>Give the physiology of the circulatory organs.</i> 352. What do
the contraction and relaxation of the muscular walls of the heart
produce? How do the auricles and ventricles contract and dilate?
353. What is said of the contraction and dilatation of the ventricles in
the heart? How is the right ventricle adapted to its function? How
the left? 354. What is the use of the valves in the heart? Those of
the aorta and pulmonary artery?</p>
<p>355. The function of the different parts of the heart
will be given, by aid of fig.&nbsp;74. The blood passes from the
right auricle (3) into the right ventricle, (5,) and the tricuspid
valves (6) prevent its reflux; from the right ventricle the
blood is forced into the pulmonary artery, (7,) through which
it passes to the lungs. The semilunar valves (9) prevent
this circulating fluid returning to the ventricle. The blood,
while passing over the air-cells in the lungs, in the minute
divisions of the pulmonary artery, is changed from a bluish
color to a bright red. It is then returned to the left auricle
of the heart by the pulmonary veins, (11, 11.)</p>

to the lungs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If the blood is not changed in the lungs, it
will not flow to the pulmonary veins. This phenomenon is
seen in instances of death from drowning, strangling, carbonic
acid, &amp;c. The same is true, but in a less degree, of individuals
whose apparel is tight, as well as of those who breathe
impure air, or have diseased lungs.</p>
<p>356. The left auricle, (12,) by its contraction, forces the
blood into the left ventricle, (14.) The mitral valves (15) prevent
its reflowing. From the left ventricle the blood is forced
into the aorta, (16,) through which, and its subdivisions, it is
distributed to every part of the system. The semilunar valves
(17) prevent its returning.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The parts of the circulatory organs most
liable to disease are the valves of the heart, particularly the
mitral. When these membranous folds become ossified or
ruptured, the blood regurgitates, and causes great distress in
breathing. The operations of the system are thus disturbed
as the movements of the steam engine would be if its valves
were injured, or did not play freely.</p>
<p>357. The difference between the functions of the pulmonary
artery and aorta is, the former communicates with the
right ventricle of the heart, and distributes only impure blood
to the lungs; the other connects with the left ventricle of the
heart, and distributes pure blood to the whole body, the lungs
not excepted. At the extremity of the divisions of the aorta,
as well as the pulmonary artery, are found capillary vessels.
This curious net-work of vessels connects with the minute
veins of the body, which return the blood to the heart.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The function of the veins of the systemic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
circulation is similar to the office of the arteries in the lungs,
and that the veins of the pulmonic circulation transmit to the
heart the pure, or nutrient blood, and thus supply the arteries
of the general system with assimilating fluid.</p>
<p class='box'>What is the effect when the blood is not changed in the lungs?
356. Describe the circulation of the blood from the left auricle to the
general system. What part of the circulatory organs is most liable to
disease? What is the effect when the valves are diseased? 357. Give the
difference in the functions of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Show the
relation between the functions of the arteries and veins both of the pulmonic
and systemic circulation.</p>
<p>358. The veins that receive the blood from all parts of the
body, follow nearly the same course as the arteries. The
myriads of these small vessels beneath the skin, and others
that accompany the arteries, at last unite and form two large
trunks, called <i>ve&acute;na ca&acute;va as-cend&acute;ens</i>, and <i>de-scend&acute;ens</i>.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> A peculiarity is presented in the veins which
come from the stomach, spleen, pancreas, and intestines.
After forming a large trunk, they enter the liver, and ramify
like the arteries, and in this organ they again unite into a
trunk, and enter the ascending vein, or cava, near the heart.
This is called the portal circulation.</p>
<p>359. The ventricles of the heart contract, or the &ldquo;pulse&rdquo;
beats, about seventy-five times every minute; in adults; in
infants, more than a hundred times every minute; in old
persons, less than seventy-five times every minute. The
energy of the contraction of this organ varies in different
individuals of the same age. It is likewise modified by the
health and tone of the system. It is difficult to estimate the
muscular power of the heart; but, comparing it with other
muscles, and judging from the force with which blood is
ejected from a severed artery, it must be very great.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The phenomenon known under the name of
pulse, is the motion caused by the pressure of the blood
against the coats of the arteries at each contraction of the
ventricles.</p>
<p>360. The following experiment will demonstrate that the
blood flows from the heart. Apply the fingers upon the artery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
at the wrist, at two different points, about two inches apart;
if the pressure be moderately made, the &ldquo;pulse&rdquo; will be felt
at both points. Let the point nearest the heart be pressed
firmly, and there will be no pulsation at the lower point; but
make strong pressure upon the lower point only, and the pulsation
will continue at the upper point, proving that the blood
flows from the heart, in the arteries, to different parts of the
system.</p>
<p class='box'>358. What is the course of the veins? What peculiarity is observable
in the veins of the liver? 359. How often does the heart contract, or the
pulse beat, in adults? In infants? In old persons? What is said of the
energy of its contraction in different persons? How is the pulse produced?
360. Demonstrate by experiment that the blood flows from the heart.</p>
<p>361. There are several influences, either separately or
combined that propel the blood from the heart through the
arteries, among which may be named,&mdash;1st. The contraction
of the muscular walls of the heart. 2d. The contractile and
elastic middle coat of the arteries aids the heart in impelling
the blood to the minute vessels of the system. 3d. The
peculiar action of the minute capillary vessels is considered,
by some physiologists, as a motive power in the arterial circulation.
4th. The pressure of the muscles upon the arteries,
when in a state of contraction, is a powerful agent, particularly
when they are in active exercise.</p>
<p>362. The following experiments will demonstrate that the
blood from every part of the system flows to the heart by the
agency of the veins. 1st. Press firmly on one of the veins
upon the back of the hand, carrying the pressure toward the
fingers; for a moment, the vein will disappear. On removing
the pressure of the finger, it will reappear, from the blood
rushing in from below.</p>
<p>2d. If a tape be tied around the arm above the elbow, the
veins below will become larger and more prominent, and also
a greater number will be brought in view, while the veins
above the tape are less distended. At this time, apply the finger
at the wrist, and the pulsation of the arteries still continues,
showing that the blood is constantly flowing from the heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
through the arteries, into the veins; and the increased size of
the veins shows that the pressure of the tape prevents its
flowing back to the heart.</p>
<p class='box'>361. State the influences that propel the blood from the heart. 362. Demonstrate
by the first experiment that the blood flows to the heart. By the
second experiment.</p>
<p>363. The influences that return the blood to the heart through
the veins, are not so easily understood as those that act on the
blood in the arteries. Some physiologists have imputed an
active propulsive power to the capillary vessels in carrying
the blood through the veins. This is not easily explained,
and perhaps it is as difficult to understand. An influence
upon which others have dwelt, is the suction power of the
heart in active dilatation, acting as a <i>vis a fronte</i> (power in
front) in drawing blood to it.</p>
<p>364. Another influence that aids the venous circulation is
attributed to the propulsive power of the heart. It is not
easy to comprehend how this power of the heart can be
extended through the capillary vessels to the blood in the
veins. Again, an important agency has been found, by some
physiologists, in the inspiratory movements, which are supposed
to draw the blood of the veins into the chest, in order
to supply the vacuum which is created there by the elevation
of the ribs and the descent of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>365. One of the most powerful causes which influence the
venous circulation, is the frequently-recurring action of the
muscles upon the venous trunks. When the muscles are
contracted, they compress that portion of the veins which lie
beneath the swell, and thus force the blood from one valve to
the other, toward the heart. When they are relaxed, the
veins refill, and are compressed by the recurring action of
the muscles.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The physician, in opening a vein, relies on
the energetic contractions and sudden relaxations of the
muscles, when he directs the patient to clasp the head of a
cane, or the arm of a chair; these alternate motions of the
muscles cause an increased flow of blood to the veins of the
ligated arm.</p>
<p class='box'>363. What is said of the influences that return the blood to the heart?
What is said of the propulsive power of the capillaries? Of the suction
power of the heart? 364. Give another influence. State another agency.
365. What is one of the most powerful causes which influence venous
circulation? Give practical observation.</p>

From the right ventricle of the heart, (2,) the dark, impure blood is forced into the pulmonary artery, (3,) and its branches (4, 5) carry the blood to the left and right lung. In the capillary vessels (6, 6) of the lungs, the blood becomes pure, or of a red color, and is returned to the left auricle of the heart, (9,) by the veins, (7, 8.) From the left auricle the pure blood passes into the left ventricle, (10.) By a forcible contraction of the left ventricle of the heart, the blood is thrown into the aorta, (11.) Its branches (12, 13, 13) carry the pure blood to every organ or part of the body. The divisions and subdivisions of the aorta terminate in capillary vessels, represented by 14, 14. In these hair-like vessels the blood becomes dark colored, and is returned to the right auricle of the heart (1) by the vena cava descendens, (15,) and vena cava ascendens, (16.) The tricuspid valves (17) prevent the reflow of the blood from the right ventricle to the right auricle. The semilunar valves (18) prevent the blood passing from the pulmonary artery to the right ventricle. The mitral valves (19) prevent the reflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left auricle. The semilunar valves (20) prevent the reflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>366. The muscles exercise an agency in maintaining the
venous circulation at a point above what the heart could perform.
As the pulsations are diminished by rest, so they are
accelerated by exercise, and very much quickened by violent
effort. There can be little doubt that the increased rapidity
of the return of blood through the veins, is, of itself, a
sufficient cause for the accelerated movements of the heart
during active exercise.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The quantity of blood in different individuals
varies. From twenty-five to thirty-five pounds may be considered
an average estimate in a healthy adult of medium size.
The time in which the blood courses through the body and
returns to the heart, is different in different individuals. Many
writers on physiology unconditionally limit the period to three
minutes. It is undeniable that the size and health of a person,
the condition of the heart, lungs, and brain, the quantity
of the circulating fluid, the amount and character of the
inspired air, and the amount of muscular action, exert a modifying
influence. The time probably varies from three to
eight minutes.</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE CIRCULATORY ORGANS</h3>
</div>
<p>367. <span class='smcap'>If</span> any part of the system is deprived of blood, its
vitality will cease; but, if the blood is lessened in quantity to
a limited extent, only the vigor and health of the part will be
impaired. The following conditions, if observed, will favor
the free and regular supply of blood to all portions of the
system.</p>
<p>368. <i>The clothing should be loosely worn.</i> Compression
of any kind impedes the passage of blood through the vessels
of the compressed portion. Hence, no article of apparel
should be worn so as to prevent a free flow of blood through
every organ of the body.</p>
<p>369. The blood which passes to and from the brain, flows
through the vessels of the neck. If the dressing of this part
of the body is close, the circulation will be impeded, and the
functions of the brain will be impaired. This remark is particularly
important to scholars, public speakers, and individuals
predisposed to apoplexy, and other diseases of the brain.</p>
<p>370. As many of the large veins lie immediately beneath
the skin, through which the blood is returned from the lower
extremities, if the ligatures used to retain the hose, or any
other article of apparel, in proper position, be tight and
inelastic, the passage of blood through these vessels will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
obstructed, producing, by their distention, the varicose, or
enlarged veins. Hence elastic bands should always be used
for these purposes.</p>
<p class='box'>367&ndash;386. <i>Give the hygiene of the circulatory organs.</i> 367. What effect
will be produced on the body if it is deprived of blood? If the blood is
only lessened in quantity? 368. Why should the clothing be worn loose?
369. What is said of dressing the neck? To what persons is this remark
applicable? 370. How are enlarged veins frequently produced?</p>
<p>371. <i>An equal temperature of all parts of the system promotes
health.</i> A chill on one portion of the body diminishes
the size of its circulating vessels, and the blood which
should distend and stimulate the chilled part, will accumulate
in other organs. The deficiency of blood in the chilled portion
induces weakness, while the superabundance of sanguineous
fluid may cause disease in another part of the system.</p>
<p>372. <i>The skin should be kept not only of an equal, but at its
natural temperature.</i> If the skin is not kept warm by adequate
clothing, so that chills shall not produce a contraction of the
blood-vessels and a consequent paleness, the blood will recede
from the surface of the body, and accumulate in the internal
organs. Cleanliness of the skin is likewise necessary, for the
reason, that this condition favors the free action of the cutaneous
vessels.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When intending to ride in a cold day, wash
the face, hands, and feet, in cold water, and rub them smartly
with a coarse towel. This is far better to keep the extremities
warm, than to take spirits into the stomach.</p>
<p>373. <i>Exercise promotes the circulation of the blood.</i> As
the action of the muscles is one of the important agents which
propel the blood through the arteries and veins, daily and
regular exercise of the muscular system is required to sustain
a vigorous circulation in the extremities and skin, and also to
maintain a healthy condition of the system. The best stimulants
to improve the sluggish circulation of an indolent patient,
whose skin is pale and whose extremities are cold, are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
union of vigorous muscular exercise with agreeable mental
action, and the systematic application to the skin of cold
water, attended with friction.</p>
<p class='box'>371. Why should the temperature of the body be equal? 372. Why
should the skin be kept at its natural, as well as at an equal temperature?
What practical observation when intending to ride in a cold day? 373. Why
does exercise promote health? What are good stimulants for sluggish
circulation in the indolent?</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> The coach-driver and teamster throw their
arms around their bodies to warm them when cold. The
muscles that are called into action in swinging the arms, force
a greater quantity of blood into the chilled parts, and consequently,
more heat is produced.</p>
<p>374. When a number of muscles are called into energetic
action, a greater quantity of blood will be propelled to the
lungs and heart in a given time, than when the muscles are
in a state of comparative inaction. It is no uncommon occurrence,
that before there is a proper expansion of the respiratory
organs to correspond with the frequency and energy of
the movements of the muscles, there is an accumulation of
blood in the lungs, attended by a painful sensation of fulness
and oppression in the chest, with violent and irregular action
of the heart. This condition of the organs of the chest, called
<i>congestion</i>, may be followed by cough, inflammation of the
lungs, asthma, and a structural disease of the heart.</p>
<p>375. To avoid these sensations and results, when we feel
necessitated to walk or run a considerable distance in a short
time, commence the movements in a moderate manner
increasing the speed as the respiratory movements become
more frequent and their expansion more extensive, so that a
sufficient amount of air may be received into the lungs to
purify the increased quantity of blood forced into them. The
same principles should be observed when commencing labor,
and in driving horses and other animals.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When a large number of muscles are called
into action after repose, as when we rise from a recumbent or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
sitting posture, the blood is impelled to the heart with a very
strong impetus. If that organ should be diseased, it may
arrive there in larger quantities than can be disposed of, and
death may be the result. Hence the necessity of avoiding all
sudden and violent movements, on the part of those who have
either a functional or structural disease of the heart.</p>
<p class='box'>Mention the illustration. 374. What is the effect when a number of
muscles are called into energetic action? What effect has this accumulation
of blood in the lungs? 375. How can such disagreeable sensations
be avoided? Mention a practical observation.</p>
<p>376. <i>The mind exercises no inconsiderable influence upon
the circulatory organs.</i> When an individual is stimulated by
hope, or excited by anger, the heart beats more forcibly, and
the arteries act more energetically, than when a person is
influenced by fear, despair, or sorrow. Consequently, the
system is more fully nourished, and capable of greater exertion,
when the former condition obtains, than when the latter
exists.</p>
<p>377. <i>The quality and quantity of the blood modify the
action of the heart and blood-vessels.</i> If this fluid is
abundant and pure, the circulatory vessels act with more
energy than when it is deficient in quantity or defective in
quality.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. In an athletic man, whose heart beats
forcibly, and whose pulse is strong, if a considerable quantity
of blood is drawn from a vein, as in bleeding, the heart will
beat feebly, and the pulse will become weak.</p>
<p>2d. When the blood is made impure by inhaling vitiated air,
the action of the heart and arteries is diminished, which produces
an effect similar to that which takes place when blood
is drawn from a vein.</p>
<p>378. <i>Hemorrhage from divided arteries should be immediately
arrested.</i> When large blood-vessels are wounded or
cut, the flow of blood must be immediately stopped, or the
person soon faints, and the heart ceases its action. If it is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>

<p>380. When an artery of the arm is cut, elevating the
wounded limb above the head will tend to arrest the flow of
blood. In a wound of a lower limb, raise the foot, so that it
shall be higher than the hip, until the bleeding ceases.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> On one occasion, the distinguished Dr. Nathan
Smith was called to a person who had divided one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
the large arteries below the knee. After trying in vain to
find the bleeding vessel, so as to secure it, he caused the foot
to be elevated higher than the hip. At the first instant the
blood was forced from the wound about twelve inches; in
a minute, it was diminished to three or four; and, in a
short time, the bleeding ceased. This Dr. S. called his
&ldquo;<i>great</i>&rdquo; operation; and it was truly great in <i>simplicity</i>
and <i>science</i>.</p>
<p class='box'>What is shown by fig.&nbsp;78 and 79? 380. What suggestion relative to
the position of a limb when bleeding? Relate a simple operation by
Dr. Nathan Smith.</p>
<p>381. The practical utility of every person knowing the
proper means of arresting hemorrhage from severed arteries,
is illustrated by the following incidents. In 1848, in the town
of N., Mass., a mechanic divided the femoral artery; although
several adult persons were present, he died in a few minutes
from loss of blood, because those persons were ignorant of the
method of compressing severed arteries until a surgeon could
be obtained.</p>
<p>382. In 1846, a similar accident occurred in the suburbs
of Philadelphia. While the blood was flowing copiously, a
lad, who had received instruction on the treatment of such
accidents at the Philadelphia High School, rushed through
the crowd that surrounded the apparently dying man,
placed his finger upon the divided vessel, and continued
the compression until the bleeding artery was secured by a
surgeon.</p>
<p>383. In &ldquo;flesh wounds,&rdquo; when no large blood-vessel is
divided, wash the part with cold water, and, when bleeding
has ceased, draw the incision together, and retain it with
narrow strips of adhesive plaster. These should be put on
smoothly, and a sufficient number applied to cover the wound.
In most instances of domestic practice, the strips of adhesive
plaster are too wide. They should not exceed in width one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
fourth of an inch. Then apply a loose bandage, and avoid
all &ldquo;healing salves,&rdquo; ointments, and washes. In removing
the dressing from a wound, both ends of the strips of plaster
should be raised and drawn toward the incision. The liability
of the wound re-opening is thus diminished.</p>
<p class='box'>381. Relate the first incident showing the utility of every person knowing
the proper method of arresting the flow of blood from divided arteries.
382. The second incident. <a name='TC_67'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">383.</ins> How should &ldquo;flesh wounds&rdquo; be
dressed?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The union of the divided parts is effected by
the action of the divided blood-vessels, and not by salves and
ointments. The only object of the dressing is to keep the
parts together, and protect the wound from air and impurities.
<i>Nature</i>, in all cases of injuries, performs her own cure. Such
simple wounds do not generally require a second dressing
and should not be opened until the incisions are healed.</p>

<p>384. In wounds made by pointed instruments, as a nail, or
in lacerated wounds, as those made by forcing a blunt instrument,
as a hook, into the soft parts, there will be no direct
and immediate union. In these cases, apply a soothing poultice,
as one made of linseed meal, and also keep the limb
still. It is judicious to consult a physician immediately, in
punctured or lacerated wounds, because they often induce
the most dangerous diseases.</p>
<p>385. Wounds caused by the bite of rabid animals or venomous
serpents, should be immediately cleansed with pure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
water. In many instances, the application of suction, either
with &ldquo;cupping glasses,&rdquo; or the mouth, will prevent the introduction
of the poisonous matter into the system by absorption.
When this is effected, cover the wound with a soothing
poultice, as one made of slippery elm bark.</p>

wounds. If the incision be upon the anterior part of the leg,
between the knee and ankle, extending the knee and bending
the ankle will aid its closing. If it be upon the back part of
the leg, by extending the foot and bending the knee, the

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>ABSORPTION.</h3>
</div>
<p>387. <span class='smcap'>Absorption</span> is the process by which the materials of
nutrition are removed from the alimentary canal, to be conveyed
into the circulatory vessels. It is likewise the process
by which the particles of matter that have become injurious,
or useless, are removed from the mass of fluids and solids
of which the body is composed. These renovating and
removing processes are performed by two sets of vessels</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS.</h3>
</div>
<p>388. The vessels that act exclusively for the growth and
renovation of the system, are found only in the alimentary
canal. They are called lacteals. The vessels whose sole
function is to remove particles of matter already deposited,
are called <i>Lym-phat&acute;ics</i>. The radicles, or commencement of
the veins, in many, and it may be in all parts of the body,
perform the office of absorption.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> This fact accounts for the capacity of the
venous system exceeding the arterial. Had the veins no other
function to perform, beside returning the blood that had been
distributed by the arteries, it would be reasonable to suppose
that this system would be less than the arterial, but the reverse
is known to be true.</p>
<p>389. The <span class='smcaplc'>LYMPHATIC VESSELS</span>, in structure, resemble the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
lacteals. They exist in great numbers in the skin and mucous
membranes, particularly those of the lungs. Though no
lymphatics have been traced to the brain, it is presumed that
they exist there, as this part of the body is not exempt from
the composition and decomposition, which are perpetual in
the body. These vessels are extremely minute at their origin,
so that in many parts of the system they cannot be detected
without the aid of a microscope.</p>

<p>390. The lymphatic vessels, like the veins, diminish in
number as they increase in size, while pursuing their course
toward the large veins near the heart, into which they pour
their contents. The walls of these vessels have two coats
of which the external one is cellular, and is capable of considerable
distention. The internal coat is folded so as to form
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
valves, like those in the veins. Their walls are so thin, that
these folds give them the appearance of being knotted.</p>

respect do these vessels resemble the veins of the system? Give the
structure of their coats.</p>
<p>391. At certain points, the lymphatic vessels pass through
distinct, soft bodies, peculiar to themselves, which are called
<i>lymphatic glands</i>, which are to these vessels what the mesenteric
glands are to the lacteals. The lymphatic glands vary
in form and in size. They are extremely vascular, and
appear to consist of a collection of minute vessels. These
glands are found in different parts of the body, but are most
numerous in the groins, axilla, or arm-pits, neck, and cavities
of the chest and abdomen.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> From exposure to cold, these glands are
frequently enlarged and inflamed. They are known under
the name of &ldquo;kernels.&rdquo; They are often diseased, particularly
in scrofula, or &ldquo;king&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo;</p>

<a name='PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_LYMPHATIC_VESSELS' id='PHYSIOLOGY_OF_THE_LYMPHATIC_VESSELS'></a>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS.</h3>
</div>
<p>392. Though the lacteals and lymphatics resemble each
other in their structure and termination, yet they differ as to
the nature of the fluids which they convey, as well as the
nature of their functions. The lacteals open into the small
intestine, and possess the power of rejecting all substances in
the passing aliment, but the chyle. The lymphatics, on the
contrary, not only imbibe all the various constituents of the
body, both fluid and solid, but they sometimes absorb foreign
and extraneous substances, when presented to their mouths,
as in vaccination.</p>
<p>393. The varieties of absorption are, the <i>In-ter-sti&acute;tial</i>,
<i>Rec-re-men-ti&acute;tial</i>, <i>Ex-cre-men-ti&acute;tial</i>, <i>Cu-ta&acute;ne-ous</i>, <i>Res-pi&acute;ra-to-ry</i>,
<i>Ve&acute;nous</i>, and the <i>Lac&acute;te-al</i>.</p>
<p class='box'>391. Describe the lymphatic glands. What observation is given in regard
to these glands? 392&ndash;403. <i>Give the physiology of the lymphatic vessels.</i>
392. Explain the difference between the lacteals and lymphatics
393. Name the varieties of absorption.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>394. <span class='smcap'>Interstitial</span> absorption is that change which is constantly
going on in the animal economy among the particles
of matter of which every texture is composed. The ordinary
functions of the body, in health, require incessant action of the
lymphatics; the circulatory system, with its myriads of small
vessels, is constantly depositing new atoms of matter, which
become vitalized, and perform a course of actions, then die,
or become useless. These old atoms are removed by the
absorbent system. Thus, wherever there is a minute artery
to deposit a living particle of matter, there is a lymphatic
vessel, or venous radicle, to remove it as soon as it shall have
finished its particular office.</p>
<p>395. The action of the lymphatic vessels counterbalances
those of nutrition, and thus the form and size of every part
of the body is preserved. When their action exceeds that of
the nutrient vessels, the body emaciates; when it is deficient,
plethora is the result. In youth, they are less active than the
nutrient vessels, and the limbs are plump; but in later periods
of life, we find these actions reversed, and the body diminishes
in size. It is not unfrequent that wens, and other tumors of
considerable size, disappear, and even the entire bone of a
limb has been removed from the same general cause. The
effused fluids of bruises are also removed by absorption.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. When little or no food is taken into the
stomach, life is supported by the lymphatic vessels and veins
imbibing the fat and reconveying it into the blood vessels. It is
the removal of this secretion which causes the emaciation of
the face and extremities of a person recovering from a fever.
In consumption, the extreme attenuation of the limbs is caused
by the absorption, not only of the fat, but also of the muscles
and more solid parts of the system.</p>
<p class='box'>394. What is interstitial absorption? Flow are the new atoms of matter
deposited? How removed? 395. What vessels do the lymphatics counterbalance
in action? What is the result when their action exceeds that
of the nutrient vessels? When it is less? Mention some instances of
active absorption. What causes the emaciated limbs of a person recovering
from fever? The extreme attenuation in consumption?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>2d. Animals which live in a half torpid state during the
winter, derive their nourishment from the same source. In
other words, we may say the starving animal lives for a
time upon itself, eating up, by internal absorption, such
parts of the body as can be spared under urgent necessity,
to feed those organs and continue those functions that are
absolutely essential to life.</p>
<p>396. <span class='smcap'>Recrementitial</span> absorption is the removal of those
fluids from the system, which are secreted upon surfaces that
have no external outlet. These fluids are various, as the fat,
the marrow, the synovia of joints, serous fluids, and the humors
of the eye. Were it not for this variety of absorption, dropsy
would generally exist in the cavities of the brain, chest, and
abdomen, from the continued action of the secretory vessels.</p>
<p>397. <span class='smcap'>Excrementitial</span> absorption relates to the fluids which
have been excreted, such as the bile, pancreatic fluid, saliva,
milk, and other secretions.</p>
<p>398. <span class='smcap'>Cutaneous</span> absorption relates to the skin. Here the
lymphatic vessels extend only to the cuticle, which they do
not permeate. There has been much diversity of opinion on
the question of cutaneous absorption; some maintaining that
this membrane absorbs, while others deny it. Many experiments
have proved that the skin may absorb sufficient nutriment
to support life for a time, by immersing the patient in a
bath of milk or broth. It has been found that the hand, immersed
to the wrist in warm water, will absorb from ninety
to one hundred grains of fluid in the space of an hour.</p>
<p>399. Thirst may be quenched by applying moist clothes to
the skin, or by bathing. It is no uncommon occurrence, during
a passage from one continent to the other, for the saliva
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
to become bitter by the absorption of sea water. Medicinal
substances, such as mercury, morphine, and Spanish flies, are
frequently introduced into the system through the skin.</p>
<p class='box'>396. What is recrementitial absorption? 397. Define excrementitial
absorption. 393. To what does cutaneous absorption relate? Is there a
diversity of opinion respecting this variety of absorption? What do well
attested experiments show? 399. What remark in reference to quenching
thirst? What agency conveys medicinal substances and ointments into
the system when tabbed on the skin?</p>
<p>400. <span class='smcap'>Respiratory</span> absorption has reference to the lungs.
The mucous membrane of these organs is abundantly supplied
with lymphatic vessels. By their action, substances
finely pulverized, or in the form of gas, are readily imbibed
when inhaled into the lungs, such as metallic vapors, odoriferous
particles, <i>tobacco smoke</i>, and other effluvia. In this way,
contagious diseases are frequently contracted.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> In inhaling sulphuric ether, or letheon, it is
introduced into the vessels of the lungs in the form of vapor,
and through them it is rapidly conveyed to the brain, and thus
influences the nervous system.</p>
<p>401. <span class='smcap'>Venous</span> absorption is the function which the veins
perform in absorbing from the alimentary canal liquids of
various kinds that have been taken into the stomach and are
not converted into chyle. In other parts of the body, they
also perform the common office of lymphatics.</p>
<p>402. <span class='smcap'>Lacteal</span>, or digestive absorption has reference to the
absorption of chyle only, which is destined for the nutrition
of the body.</p>
<p>403. Absorption is not only very abundant, but generally
very rapid, and all these varieties are maintained through life,
except when suspended by disease.</p>

<p>404. By the action of the lymphatics, substances of an
injurious, as well as of a beneficial, character may be conveyed
into the system. These vessels, under certain conditions,
are more active in their office than at other periods;
and it is of practical utility to know what influences their
action.</p>
<p>405. <i>The function of these vessels is increased by moisture,
and lessened by an active state of the lacteals.</i> Observation
shows that the ill-fed, and those persons that live in marshy
districts, contract contagious diseases more readily than those
individuals who are well fed, and breathe a dry and pure air.</p>
<p>406. <i>The air of the sick-room should be dry.</i> If due
attention is not given to ventilation, the clothing of the nurse
and patient, together with the air of the room, will be moistened
by the exhalations from the skin and lungs. This
exhalation may contain a poison of greater or less power,
according to its quantity and degree of concentration, and
may be absorbed and reconveyed into the system, causing
inflammatory diseases, and not unfrequently death.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. When we are attending a sick person
a current of air that has passed over the patient should be
avoided. We may approach with safety very near a person who
has an infectious disease, provided care is taken to keep on the
side from which the currents of air are admitted into the room.</p>
<p>2d. When we have been visiting or attending on a sick
person, it is judicious to change the apparel worn in the

and digestible character, in proper quantities, and at stated
periods.</i> The chyle formed from the food stimulates the lacteals
to activity, which activity is attended with an inactive
state of the lymphatics of the skin and lungs. Thus due
attention should be given to the food of the attendants on the
sick, and the members of the family. Before visiting a sick
person it is judicious to take a moderate amount of nutritious
food.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Many individuals, to prevent contracting disease
that may be communicated from one person to another,
use tobacco, either chewed or smoked; and sometimes alcohol,
with decoctions of bitter herbs. These substances do not
diminish, but tend to increase, the activity of the lymphatics.
Thus they make use of the means by which the poisonous
matter formed in the system of the diseased person, may be
more readily conveyed into their <a name='TC_70'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">own.</ins></p>
<p>408. <i>The skin and clothing, as well as the bed-linen, should
be frequently cleansed.</i> This will remove the poisonous matter
that may be deposited upon the skin and garments, which, if
suffered to remain, might be conveyed into the system by
the action of the lymphatics. This points also to a frequent
change of the wearing apparel, as well as the coverings of
the bed. In visiting the unhealthy districts of the South and
West, the liability of contracting disease is much lessened by
taking a supply of food at proper periods, keeping the skin and
clothing in a clean state, the room well ventilated, and avoiding
the damp chills of evening.</p>
<p>409. <i>Absorption by the skin is most vigorous when the
cuticle is removed by vesication, or blistering.</i> Then external
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
applications are brought into immediate contact with the
orifices of the lymphatics of the skin, and by them rapidly
imbibed and circulated through the system. Thus arsenic
applied to the cutaneous vessels, and strong solutions of opium
to extensive burns, have been absorbed in quantities sufficient
to poison the patient.</p>
<p class='box'>407. Why should the stomach be supplied with food of a nutrient and
digestible character? What is said of the use of alcohol, or tobacco, in
preventing the introduction of the poisonous matter of contagious diseases?
408. Why should the clothing and bed-linen be frequently washed? What
suggestion to persons in visiting the unhealthy districts of the South and
West? 409. When is cutaneous absorption most vigorous? Why?</p>
<p>410. <i>When the cuticle is only punctured or abraded,
poisonous matter may be introduced into the system.</i> The
highly respected Dr. W., of Boston, lost his life by poisonous
matter from the body of a patient subjected to a post mortem
examination. He had removed from his finger, previous to
the examination, a &ldquo;hang-nail,&rdquo; and the poison from the
dead body was brought in contact with the denuded part, and
through the agency of the lymphatics it was conveyed into the
system.</p>
<p>411. Puncture any part of the cuticle with the finest
instrument that has upon its point the smallest conceivable
quantity of the <i>vaccine virus</i>, or small-pox matter, and it will
be brought into contact with the lymphatic vessels, and
through their agency conveyed into the system. The result
is, that persons thus operated upon have the small-pox, or
the vaccine disease.</p>
<p>412. When we expose ourselves to any poisonous vapors,
or handle diseased animals or sick persons, safety and health
require that the cuticle be not broken or otherwise injured. In
many instances, the poisonous animal matter upon hides has
been introduced into the systems of tanners, through small
ulcers upon their fingers or hands. From these sores there
would be seen small red lines extending up the arm. These
swelled tracts indicate an inflammation of the large lymphatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
trunks, that have been irritated and diseased by the passage of
poisonous matter through them into the system.</p>
<p class='box'>410. Do the same results follow, if the cuticle is only punctured? Relate
an instance of death by the absorption of poisonous matter. 411. By
what means is the vaccine matter introduced into the system?
412. What caution is necessary when we expose ourselves to poisonous
vapors?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> A distressing illustration of the absorption of
deleterious substances from the surface of a sore, is seen in
the favorite experiments of that class of &ldquo;quacks,&rdquo; who style
themselves &ldquo;cancer doctors.&rdquo; With them, every trifling and
temporary enlargement, or tumor, is a cancer. Their <a name='TC_71'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'gen eral' over line.">general</ins>
remedy is arsenic; and happy is the unfortunate <a name='TC_72'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'suf ferer' over line.">sufferer</ins>
who escapes destruction in their hands, for too <a name='TC_73'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'frequent ly' over line.">frequently</ins>
their speedy cure is death.</p>
<p>413. In case of an accidental wound, it is best <a name='TC_74'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'imme diately' over line.">immediately</ins>
to bathe the part thoroughly in pure water, and to
avoid all irritating applications. In some instances, it would
be well to apply <i>lunar caustic</i> immediately. When handling
or shrouding dead bodies, or removing the skin from animals
that have died of disease, it would be well to lubricate the
hands with olive-oil or lard. This affords protection to the
minute portions of the skin, from which the cuticle may
be removed. In all cases where there is an ulcer or sore, the
part should be covered with something impervious to fluids,
as court-plaster, before exposing the system to any animal,
vegetable, or mineral poison.</p>
<p class='box'>413. What direction is given when the cuticle is broken? What suggestion
is given when shrouding dead bodies?</p>

<p>414. <span class='smcap'>In</span> the human body are found many fluids and solids
of dissimilar appearance and character. These are produced
by the action of organs, some of which are of simple structure,
while others are very complicated in their arrangement.
These organs are called <i>Se-cre&acute;to-ry</i>.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE SECRETORY ORGANS.</h3>

and the <i>Glands</i>.</p>
<p>416. The <span class='smcaplc'>EXHALANTS</span> were supposed to be terminations of

the skin and mucous membranes; the internal in the cellular
and medullary tissues. (<a href='#APPENDIX_I'>Appendix I.</a>)</p>

<p>418. The <span class='smcaplc'>GLANDS</span> are soft, fleshy organs, and as various in
their structure, as the secretions which it is their function to
produce. Each gland is composed of many small lobules
united in a compact mass, and each lobule communicates by
a small duct with the principal outlet, or duct of the organ.
Every gland is supplied with arteries, veins, lymphatics, and
nerves. These, with the ducts, are arranged in a peculiar
manner, and connected by cellular membrane.</p>
<p>419. There are two classes of glands, one for the modification
of the fluids which pass through them, as the mesenteric
and lymphatic glands; and the other for the secretion of fluids
which are either useful in the animal economy, or require to
be rejected from the body.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SECRETORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>420. <span class='smcap'>Secretion</span> is one of the most obscure and <a name='TC_78'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'mys terious' over line.">mysterious</ins>
functions of the animal economy. &ldquo;It is that process
by which various substances are separated from the blood,
either with or without experiencing any change during their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
separation.&rdquo; Not only is the process by which substances are
separated from the blood, called secretion, but the same term
is also applied to substances thus separated. Thus physiologists
say, that by the process of secretion, bile is formed by
the liver; and also, that bile is the secretion of this organ.</p>
<p class='box'>418. Give the structure of the glands. 419. How are the glands arranged?
420&ndash;431. <i>Give the physiology of the secretory organs.</i> 420. What is <a name='TC_79'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'secre tion' over line.">secretion</ins>?</p>
<p>421. The secreted fluids do not exist in that form in the
blood, but most of the elements of which they are made do
exist in this fluid, and the &ldquo;vessels by which it is accomplished
may well be called the architects and chemists of the system;
for out of the same material&mdash;the blood&mdash;they construct a
variety of wonderful fabrics and chemical compounds. We
see the same wonderful power possessed, also, by vegetables;
for out of the same materials the olive prepares its oil, the
cocoa-nut its milk, the cane its sugar, the poppy its narcotic,
the oak its green pulpy leaves, and its dense woody fibre.
All are composed of the same few, simple elements, arranged
in different order and proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>422. &ldquo;In like manner we find the vessels, in animated
bodies, capable of forming all the various textures and substances
which compose the frame; the cellular tissue, the
membranes, the ligaments, the cartilages, the bones, the marrow,
the muscles with their tendons, the lubricating fluid of
the joints, the pulp of the brain, the transparent jelly of the
eye; in short, all the textures of the various organs of which
the body is composed, consist of similar ultimate elements,
and are manufactured from the blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>423. Of the agents that produce or direct the different
secretions, we have no very accurate knowledge. Some have
supposed this function to be mechanical, others a chemical
process, but experiments prove that it is dependent on nervous
influence. If the nerves are divided which are distributed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
any organ, the process of secretion is suspended. It is no
uncommon occurrence, that the nature of milk will be so
changed from the influence of anger in the mother, as to cause
vomiting, colic, and even convulsions, in the infant that swallows
it. Unexpected intelligence either of a pleasant or
unpleasant character, by its influence on the nervous system,
will frequently destroy the appetite. Sometimes mental agitation,
as fear, will cause a cold sweat to pervade the surface
of the body.</p>
<p class='box'>421. What is said respecting secreted substances? Do vegetables possess
the property of secretion? 422. From what are the various textures
formed? 423. Have we accurate knowledge of the agents that produce
secretion?</p>
<p>424. Secretions are constantly maintained, during life, from
the serous membrane, by the action of the internal exhalants.
The fluid which is exhaled bears some resemblance to the
serum of the blood. Its use is to furnish the organs, which
are surrounded by this membrane, with a proper degree of
moisture, and thus enables them to move easily on each other,
as those within the chest and abdomen.</p>
<p>425. The cellular tissue exhales a serous fluid, and when
it becomes excessive in quantity, general dropsy is produced.
Fat is another secretion, which is thrown out, in a fluid state,
from the cellular membrane. It is deposited in little cells,
and exists in the greatest abundance between the skin and the
muscles. Its use seems to be, to form a cushion around the
body for its protection; to furnish nutriment for the system
when food cannot be taken; to supply the carbon and hydrogen
necessary to sustain the generation of heat, when these
articles of combustion are not otherwise furnished. The
<i>med&acute;ul-la-ry</i> substance, (marrow,) in the cavities of the long
bones, is very much like fat.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> During sickness, if there is not emaciation
or absorption of this secretion, it is considered an unfavorable
symptom, because it indicates a want of power in the absorbing
system, which is among the last to be affected.</p>
<p class='box'>How is it proved that secretion depends on nervous influence? 424. What
is said of the secretions from the serous membrane? 425. From what tissue
is a serous fluid exhaled? What is the effect when this fluid becomes
excessive in quantity? What is fat? Its use? What is marrow?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>426. The mucous secretion is a transparent, viscid fluid
which is secreted by those membranes that line the cavities
of the body, which have an external communication, as the
trachea and alimentary canal. This secretion serves to protect
these parts from the influence of the air, and concurs, by
means of its peculiar properties, in the performance of their
functions.
427. There are two external secretions, namely, one from
the skin, called perspiration, and the other from the lungs.
The cutaneous exhalation, or transpiration<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> exists in two
forms, called sensible perspiration (sweat) and insensible perspiration.
The pulmonary exhalation is the most important
and universal, and closely resembles that of the skin.</p>
<p>428. The follicles are found only in the skin and mucous
membrane. They secrete an oily, unctuous substance, which
mixes with the transpiration, and lubricates the skin. At the
root of each hair there is a minute follicle, which secretes the
fluid that oils the hair. The wax in the passage of the ear is
secreted from these bodies.</p>
<p>429. All the blood distributed to the different glands is
similar in composition and character; but the fluids secreted
by them, vary in appearance in a remarkable degree. The
office of the glands appears to be principally to form different
secretions. Thus the salivary glands secrete the insipid
saliva; the lachrymal glands, the saline tears; the liver, the
yellow, ropy bile; and the kidneys, the acrid urine.</p>
<p class='box'>426. What is said relative to the mucous secretion? 427. Name the
external secretions. 428. Give the office of the follicles. 429. What
appears to be the principal office of the glands? 430. Mention a secretion
produced in a particular emergency.</p>
<p>430. Some secretions are evidently produced only in particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
emergencies, as is seen in the increased secretion of
bony matter when a limb is broken.</p>
<p>431. When any substance which is not demanded for
nutrition, or does not give nourishment to the system, is
imbibed by the lymphatic vessels, and conveyed into the blood,
it is eliminated in the secretions.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A few years since, a poor inebriate was
carried to a London hospital in a state of intoxication. He
lived but a few hours. On examining his brain, nearly half a
gill of fluid, strongly impregnated with gin, was found in the
cavities of this organ. This was secreted from the vessels of
the brain.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='HYGIENE_OF_THE_SECRETORY_ORGANS' id='HYGIENE_OF_THE_SECRETORY_ORGANS'></a>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE SECRETORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>432. <i>Unless the secretions are regularly maintained, disease
will be the ultimate result.</i> Let the secretions from the skin
be suppressed, and fever or some internal inflammation will
follow. If the bile is impeded, digestion will be impaired.
If any other secretion is suppressed, it will cause a derangement
of the various internal organs.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Ardent spirits derange the secretions, and
change the structure of the brain. This is one reason why
inebriates do not generally live to advanced age.</p>
<p>433. <i>The quantity of blood influences the character of the
secretions.</i> If it is lessened to any great extent, the secretions
will be lessened as well as changed in character.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> When a person has lost a considerable
quantity of blood, there is a sensation of thirst in the fauces,
attended with a cold, pale, dry skin. When reaction comes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
on, the perspiration is cold, attended with nausea, and sometimes
vomiting.</p>
<p class='box'>431. What becomes of those substances imbibed by the lymphatics that
do not give nourishment to the body. 432&ndash;437. <i>Give the hygiene of the
secretory organs.</i> 432. What effect on the system when the secretions
are not regularly maintained? 433. Does the quantity of blood influence
the secretions? Give an illustration.</p>
<p>434. <i>The secretory organs require the stimulus of pure
blood.</i> If this fluid is vitiated, the action of the secretory
organs will be more or less modified. Either the quantity
will be affected or the quality will be altered.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The impurity of the blood arising from the
inhalation of the vitiated air of sleeping rooms, diminishes
and changes the character of the secretions of the mouth and
stomach. This accounts for the thirst, coated tongue, and
disagreeable taste of the mouth when impure air is breathed
during sleep. The disease it induces, is indigestion or dyspepsia.</p>
<p>435. <i>The amount of action modifies the condition of the
secretory organs.</i> When a secretory organ is excessively
stimulated, its vigor and energy are reduced. The subsequent
debility may be so great as to suppress or destroy its
functional power.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. In those sections of the country where
flax is spun on a &ldquo;foot-wheel,&rdquo; it is not unfrequent that the
spinners moisten the thread with the secretions of the mouth.
This seems to operate economically for a time, but debility of
the salivary organs soon follows, which incapacitates them
from supplying saliva sufficient to moisten the food, producing
in a short time disease of the digestive organs.</p>
<p>2d. The habit of continual spitting, which attends the
chewing of tobacco and gums, and other substances, between
meals, induces debility, not only of the salivary glands, but
of the system generally.</p>
<p>436. <i>One secretory organ may do the office of another.</i>
This increased action of a secretory organ may be sustained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
for a limited time without permanent injury, but, if long continued,
a diseased action of the organ will follow. Of morbid
secretions we have examples in the ossification of the
valves of the heart, cancerous and other tumors.</p>
<p class='box'>434. What is the effect of impure blood on the secretory organs?
435. What results from stimulating excessively a secretory organ? How
is this illustrated? 436. What is the effect when one secretory organ performs
the office of another?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the evenings of the warm season, a chill
upon the impressible skin, that suppresses the perspiration, is
frequently followed by a diarrh&oelig;a, dysentery, or cholera
morbus. These can be prevented by avoiding the chill. An
efficient means of relief, is immediately to restore the skin to
its proper action.</p>
<p>437. <i>The secretions are much influenced by the mind.</i> How
this is effected, it is difficult to explain; but many facts corroborate
it. Every one has felt an increased action of the tear-glands
from distressing feelings. Cheerfulness of disposition
and serenity of the passions are peculiarly favorable to the
proper performance of the secretory function. From this we
may learn how important it is to avoid such things as distract,
agitate, or harass us.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In fevers and other diseases, when the skin,
mouth, and throat are dry from a suppression of the secretions,
let the mind of the patient be changed from despondency to
hope, and the skin and the membrane that lines the mouth and
throat will exhibit a more moist condition, together with a
general improvement of the vital organs of the system.
Consequently, all just encouragement of the restoration to
health should be given to a sick person.</p>
<p class='box'>Give examples of morbid secretions. What is one cause of dysentery
and cholera morbus? How can these affections he relieved? 437. Show
the influence of the mind on the secretions. Mention instances of its
influence.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXII_NUTRITION' id='CHAPTER_XXII_NUTRITION'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>NUTRITION.</h3>
</div>
<p>438. <span class='smcap'>Nutrition</span> is the vital act by which the different
parts of the body renew the materials of which they are
composed. Digestion, circulation, absorption, and respiration,
are but separate links in the chain of nutrition,
which would be destroyed by the absence of any one of
them.</p>
<p>439. The nutritive process is also a kind of secretion, by
which particles of matter are separated from the blood and
conveyed with wonderful accuracy to the appropriate textures.
The function of the nutrient vessels antagonizes those
of absorption: while one system is constructing, with beautiful
precision, the animal frame, the other is diligently employed
in pulling down this complicated structure.</p>
<p>440. This ever-changing state of the body is shown by
giving animals colored matter, mixed with their food, which
in a short time tinges their bones with the same color as
the matter introduced. Let it be withdrawn, and in a few
days the bones will assume their former color&mdash;evidently
from the effects of absorption. The changeful state of the
body is further shown by the losses to which it is subjected;
by the necessity of aliment; by the emaciation which follows
abstinence from food.</p>
<p class='box'>438&ndash;454. <i>What remarks respecting nutrition?</i> 438. What is nutrition?
439. What is said of the nutritive process? The function of the nutrient
vessels? 440. Give a proof of the ever-changing state of the body. Give
other instances illustrative of the changeful state of the body.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>441. Every part of the body is subject to this continual
change of material, yet it is effected with such regularity,
that the size, shape, and appearance, of every organ is preserved;
and after an interval of a few years, there may not
remain a particle of matter which existed in the system at a
former period. Notwithstanding this entire change, the personal
identity is never lost.</p>
<p>442. Many calculations have been made to determine in
what length of time the whole body is renewed. Some have
supposed that it is accomplished in four years; others have
fixed the period at seven years; but the time of the change is
not definite, as was supposed by a genuine son of the Emerald
Isle, who had been in America <i>seven years and three months</i>,
and consequently maintained that he was a native American.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> India ink, when introduced into the skin, is
not removed; hence some assert that this tissue is an exception
to the alternate deposition and removal of its atoms.
The ink remains because its particles are too large to be
absorbed, and when in the skin it is insoluble.</p>
<p>443. &ldquo;Those animals which are most complicated in their
structure, and are distinguished by the greatest variety of
vital manifestations, are subject to the most rapid changes of
matter. Such animals require more frequent and more
abundant supplies of food; and, in proportion as they are
exposed to the greater number of external impressions, will
be the rapidity of this change of matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>444. &ldquo;Animals may be situated so that they lose nothing
by secretion; consequently, they will require no nutriment.
Frogs have been taken from fissures in solid lime rock, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
were imbedded many feet below the surface of the earth, and,
on being exposed to the air, exhibited signs of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>441. Why is the personal identity never lost in the change of materials,
which is unceasing in the system? 442. Give the opinion of physiologists
respecting the time required for the renewal of the whole body. What
exception to the changing state Of the different textures? 443. What
animals are subject to the most rapid changes of material? 444. May
animals be situated so that they require no nutriment? What is related
of frogs?</p>
<p>445. The renovation of the bone, muscle, ligament, tendon,
cartilage, fat, nerve, hair, &amp;c., is not perfected merely
by the general circulation of the fluid which is expelled from
the left side of the heart, but through the agency of a system
of minute vessels, which, under ordinary circumstances, cannot
be seen by the eye, even when aided by the microscope;
still, minute as they are, the function of these agents is necessary
to the continuance of life. They are the smallest capillary
vessels.</p>
<p>446. &ldquo;As the blood goes the round of the circulation, the
nutrient capillary vessels select and secrete those parts which
are similar to the nature of the structure, and the other portions
pass on; so that every tissue imbibes and converts to its
own use the very principles which it requires for its growth;
or, in other words, as the vital current approaches each organ,
the particles appropriate to it feel its attractive force,&mdash;obey
it,&mdash;quit the stream,&mdash;mingle with the substance of its
tissue,&mdash;and are changed into its own true and proper
nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>447. Thus, if a bone is broken, a muscle or a nerve
wounded, and, if the system is in a proper state of health,
the vital economy immediately sets about healing the rupture.
The blood, which flows from the wounded vessels, coagulates
in the incision, for the double purpose of stanching the wound,
and of forming a matrix for the regeneration of the parts.
Very soon, minute vessels shoot out from the living parts into
<a name='TC_80'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'he'">the</ins> coagulum of the blood, and immediately commence their
operations, and deposit bony matter, where it is required
to unite fractured bones, and nervous substance to heal the
wounded nerve, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='box'>445. Show how the renovation of the bones, muscles, &amp;c., is perfected.
446. What is said of the office of the nutrient capillary vessels? 447. When
a bone is fractured, by what process is it healed?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>448. But the vital economy seems not to possess the power
of reproducing the muscles and true skin, and therefore,
when these parts are wounded, the rupture is repaired by a
gelatinous substance, which gradually becomes hard, and
sometimes assumes something of a fibrous appearance. It so
perfectly unites the divided muscle, however, as to restore its
functional power. When the cuticle is removed, it is reproduced
and no scar remains; but, when the true skin is destroyed,
a scar is formed.</p>
<p>449. It is not uncommon that the nutrient arteries have
their action so much increased in some parts, as to produce
preternatural growth. Sometimes the vessels whose function
it is to deposit fat, are increased in action, and wens of no
inferior size are formed. Again, there may be a deposition
of substances unlike any known to exist in the body. Occasionally,
these nutrient arteries of a part take on a new action,
and not only deposit their ordinary substance, but others,
which they have not heretofore secreted, but which are formed
by vessels of other parts of the body. It is in this way that
we account for the bony matter deposited in the valves of the
heart and brain, also the chalky deposits around the finger-joints.</p>
<p>450. In infancy and childhood, the function of nutrition is
very active; a large amount of food is taken, to supply the
place of what is lost by the action of the absorbents, and also
to contribute to the growth of the body. In middle age, nutrition
and absorption are more equal; but in old age, the absorbents
are more active than the nutrient vessels. The size,
consequently, diminishes, the parts become weaker, the bones
more brittle, the body bends forward, and every function
exhibits marks of decay and dissolution.</p>
<p>451. A striking instance of active absorption in middle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
age was exhibited in the person of Calvin Edson, of Vermont,
who was exhibited in the large towns of New England,
as the &ldquo;living skeleton.&rdquo; In early manhood he was athletic,
and weighed one hundred and sixty pounds; but the excessive
action of the absorbents over the nutrient vessels, reduced
his weight, in the interval of eighteen years, to sixty
pounds.</p>
<p class='box'>448. What occurs when a muscle is divided? 449. State some of the
results of an increased action of the nutrient arteries. 450. When is nutrition
most active? How in middle age? How in old age? 451. Relate
a striking instance of active absorption in middle age.</p>
<p>452. Instances, on the other hand, have occurred, of the
action of the nutrient vessels exceeding, in an extreme degree,
those of absorption; as in the person of a colored girl,
thirteen years of age, who was exhibited in New York in the
summer of 1840. She was of the height of misses at that
age, but weighed five hundred pounds. Several cases are on
record of persons weighing eight hundred pounds.</p>
<p>453. As already mentioned, the blood is the nutritive fluid
of animals. When this fluid is coagulated, a thick, jelly-like
mass floats in the serum, called coagulum. This coagulated
mass is composed of fibrin, and red globulated matter.
The color of the red globules is owing to the presence of
iron, though some physiologists think it depends on an animal
substance of a gelatinous character.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> That portion of the serum which remains
fluid after coagulation by heat has taken place, is called
<i>se-ros&acute;i-ty</i>. It is more abundant in the blood of old, than in
that of young animals; and it forms the &ldquo;red gravy&rdquo; in
roasted meats.</p>
<p>454. The blood is not necessarily red. It may be white,
as in most fish. There is no animal in which the blood is
equally red in all parts of the body. The ligaments, tendons,
and other white tissues in man are supplied but sparingly
with red blood. The fluid that supplies these tissues is
whitish.</p>
<p class='box'>452. Of excessive nutrition in early life. 453. Describe the parts that enter
into the composition of the blood. What part of the blood forms the red gravy
in roasted meats? 454. Is the blood necessarily red? Of what color is the

<a name='HYGIENE_OF_NUTRITION' id='HYGIENE_OF_NUTRITION'></a>
<h3>HYGIENE OF NUTRITION.</h3>
</div>
<p>455. <i>Healthy nutrition requires pure blood.</i> If the nutrient
arteries of the bones are supplied with impure blood, they
will become soft or brittle, their vitality will be impaired, and
disease will be the ultimate result. The five hundred muscles
receive another portion of the blood. These organs are
attached to, and act upon the bones. Upon the health and
contractile energy of the muscles depends the ability to labor.
Give these organs of motion impure blood, which is an
unhealthy stimulus, and they will become enfeebled, the step
will lose its elasticity, the movement of the arm will be
inefficient, and every muscle will be incapacitated to perform
its usual amount of labor.</p>
<p>456. When the stomach, liver, and other organs subservient
to the digestion of food, are supplied with impure
blood, the digestive process is impaired, causing faintness and
loss of appetite, also a deranged state of the intestines, and,
in general, all the symptoms of dyspepsia.</p>
<p>457. The delicate structure of the lungs, in which the
blood is or should be purified, needs the requisite amount of
pure blood to give them vigor and health. When the blood is
not of this character, the lungs themselves lose their tone, and,
even if permitted to expand freely, have not power fully to
change the impure quality of this circulating fluid.</p>
<p>458. The health and beauty of the skin require that the
blood should be well purified; but, if the arteries of the skin
receive vitiated blood, pimples and blotches appear, and the
individual suffers from &ldquo;humors.&rdquo; Drinks, made of various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
kinds of herbs, as well as pills and powders, are taken for
this affection. These will never have the desired effect,
while the causes of impure blood exist.</p>
<p class='box'>455&ndash;462. <i>Give the hygiene of nutrition.</i> 455. What is the effect of
impure blood upon the bones? On the muscles? 456. On the digestive
organs? 457. On the lungs? 458. What is the effect if the vessels of the
skin are supplied with vitiated blood?</p>
<p>459. If the nutrient arteries convey impure material to the
brain, the nervous and bilious headache, confusion of ideas,
loss of memory, impaired intellect, dimness of vision, and
dulness of hearing, will be experienced; and in process of
time, the brain becomes disorganized, and the brittle thread
of life is broken.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. An exertion of any organ beyond its
powers, induces weakness that will disturb the nutrition of the
part that is called into action; and it recovers its energy
more slowly in proportion to the excess of the exertion. The
function of the organ may be totally and permanently destroyed,
if the exertion is extremely violent. We sometimes
see palsy produced in a muscle simply by the effort to raise
too great a weight. The sight is impaired, and total blindness
may be produced, by exposure to light too strong or too
constant. The mind may be deranged, or idiocy may follow
the excess of study or the over-tasking of the brain.</p>
<p>2d. When the function of an organ is permanently impaired
or destroyed by over-exertion, the nutrition of the part is
rendered insufficient, or is entirely arrested; and then the
absorbents remove it wholly or partially, as they do every
thing that is no longer useful. Thus, in palsied patients, a
few years after the attack, we often find scarce any trace of
the palsied muscles remaining; they are reduced almost to
simple cellular tissue. The condition of the calf of the leg,
in a person having a club-foot, is a familiar proof of this.</p>
<p>460. <i>The blood may be made impure, by the chyle being
deficient in quantity or defective in quality.</i> This state of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the chyle may be produced by the food being improper in
quantity or quality, or by its being taken in an improper
manner, at an improper time, and when the system is not
prepared for it. The remedy for impure blood produced in
any of these ways is to correct the injudicious method of
using food. (See Chapters <a href='#CHAPTER_XV_HYGIENE_OF_THE_DIGESTIVE_ORGANS'>XV.</a> and <a href='#CHAPTER_XVI_HYGIENE_OF_THE_DIGESTIVE_ORGANS_CONTINUED'>XVI.</a>)</p>
<p class='box'>459. How does impure blood affect the brain? What is the effect when
any organ is exerted beyond its powers? What is the effect when an
organ is permanently impaired? 460. How may the blood become impure?</p>
<p>461. <i>The blood may also be rendered impure, by not supplying
it with oxygen in the lungs, and by the carbon not
being eliminated from the system through this channel.</i> The
remedy for &ldquo;impurities of the blood,&rdquo; produced in this manner,
would be, to carefully reduce to practice the directions in
the chapters on the hygiene of the respiratory organs, relative
to the free movements of the ribs and diaphragm, and
the proper ventilation of rooms.</p>
<p>462. <i>A retention of the waste products of the skin produces
impure blood.</i> When the vessels of the skin, by which the
waste, useless material is eliminated from the system, have
become inactive by improper and inadequate clothing, or by
a want of cleanliness, the dead, injurious atoms of matter
are retained in the circulatory vessels. The only successful
method of purifying the blood and restoring health
when this condition exists, is to observe the directions given
relative to clothing and bathing. (See Chapters <a href='#CHAPTER_XXXIII_HYGIENE_OF_THE_SKIN'>XXXIII.</a>
and <a href='#CHAPTER_XXXIV_HYGIENE_OF_THE_SKIN_CONTINUED'>XXXIV.</a>)</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If the blood has become &ldquo;impure,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;loaded with humors,&rdquo; (an idea generally prevalent,) it is
not and cannot be &ldquo;purified&rdquo; by taking patent pills, powders,
drops, &amp;c. But, on the contrary, by observing the suggestions
in the preceding paragraphs, the blood can be freed of its
impurities, and, what is of greater importance, such &ldquo;injurious
humors&rdquo; will be prevented.</p>
<p class='box'>461. Mention another means by which the blood may be made impure.

left subclavian vein, (24, 27, fig.&nbsp;88,) at the lower part of the
neck, and is carried to the right cavities of the heart. The
fluid in these cavities consists of the chyle incorporated with
the impure blood. Neither of these two elements is fitted to
promote the growth or repair the waste of the body. They
must be subjected to a process, by which the first can be
converted into blood, and the second freed of its carbonic
acid gas and water. This is effected by the <i>Respiratory
Organs</i>.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>464. The <span class='smcaplc'>RESPIRATORY ORGANS</span> are the <i>Lungs</i>, (lights,)
the <i>Tra&acute;che-a</i>, (windpipe,) the <i>Bronch&acute;i-a</i>, (subdivisions of the
trachea,) and the <i>Air-Ves&acute;i-cles</i>, (air-cells at the extremities of
the bronchia.) The <i>Di&acute;a-phragm</i>, (midriff,) <i>Ribs</i>, and several
<i>Muscles</i>, also aid in the respiratory process.</p>
<p>465. The <span class='smcaplc'>LUNGS</span> are conical organs, one on each side of
the chest, embracing the heart, (fig.&nbsp;88,) and separated from
each other by a membranous partition. The color of the
lungs is a pinkish gray, mottled, and variously marked with
black. Each lung is divided into lobes, by a long and deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
fissure, which extends from the posterior surface of the upper
part of the organ, downward and forward, nearly to the
anterior angle of the base. In the right lung, the upper lobe
is subdivided by a second fissure. This lung is larger and
shorter than the left. It has three lobes, while the left has
only two.</p>

by a serous membrane, called the <i>pleu&acute;ra</i>, which invests it as
far as the root, and is thence reflected upon the walls of the
chest. The lungs, however, are on the outside of the pleura,
in the same way as the head is on the outside of a cap doubled
upon itself. The reflected pleur&aelig; in the middle of the thorax
form a partition, which divides the chest into two cavities.

<p><i>Observation.</i> When this membrane that covers the lungs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and also lines the chest, is inflamed, the disease is called
&ldquo;pleurisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>466. By what are the lungs enclosed? What is the relative position of
the lungs and pleura? What is said of the reflected pleur&aelig;? Explain
fig.&nbsp;90. What part of the lungs is affected in pleurisy?</p>
<p>467. The lungs are composed of the ramifications of the
bronchial tubes, which terminate in the bronchial cells, (<i>air-cells</i>,)
lymphatics, and the divisions of the pulmonary artery
and veins. All of these are connected by cellular tissue,
which constitutes the <i>pa-ren&acute;chy-ma</i>. Each lung is retained
in its place by its <i>root</i>, which is formed by the pulmonary
arteries, pulmonary veins, and bronchial tubes, together with
the bronchial vessels and pulmonary nerves.</p>
<p>468. The <span class='smcaplc'>TRACHEA</span> extends from the larynx, of which it is a
continuation, to the third dorsal vertebra, where it divides into
two parts, called bronchia. It lies anterior to the spinal column,
from which it is separated by the &oelig;sophagus.</p>
<p>469. The <span class='smcaplc'>BRONCHIA</span> proceed from the bifurcation, or division
of the trachea, to their corresponding lungs. Upon
entering the lungs, they divide into two branches, and each
branch divides and subdivides, and ultimately terminates in
small sacs, or cells, of various sizes, from the twentieth to
the hundredth of an inch in diameter. So numerous are these
bronchial or air-cells, that the aggregate extent of their lining
membrane in man has been computed to exceed a surface of
20,000 square inches, and Munro states that it is thirty times
the surface of the human body.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> The trachea may be compared to the trunk of
a tree; the bronchia, to two large branches; the subdivisions
of the bronchia, to the branchlets and twigs; the air-cells, to
the buds seen on the twigs in the spring.</p>
<p>470. The <span class='smcaplc'>AIR-VESICLES</span> and small bronchial tubes compose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
the largest portions of the lungs. These, when once inflated,
contain air, under all circumstances, which renders their specific
gravity much less than water; hence the vulgar term,
<i>lights</i>, for these organs. The trachea and bronchial tubes
are lined by mucous membrane. The structure of this membrane
is such, that it will bear the presence of pure air without
detriment, but not of other substances.</p>

be illustrated, by taking these parts of a calf or sheep and
inflating the air-vesicles by forcing air into the windpipe with
a pipe or quill. The internal structure may then be seen
by opening the different parts.</p>
<p>471. The lungs, like other portions of the system, are supplied
with nutrient arteries and nerves. The nervous filaments
that are distributed to these organs are in part from the tenth
pair, (par vagum,) that originates in the brain, and in part from
the sympathetic nerve. The muscles that elevate the ribs and
the diaphragm receive nervous fibres from a separate system,
which is called the respiratory.</p>

<p><i>Observation.</i> When the mucous membrane of a few of the
larger branches of the windpipe is slightly inflamed, it is called
a &ldquo;cold;&rdquo; when the inflammation is greater, and extends to the
lesser air-tubes, it is called <i>bronch-i&acute;tis</i>. When the air-cells
and parenchyma become inflamed, it is called inflammation
of the lungs. Coughing is a violent expulsory effort by which
air is suddenly forced through the bronchia and trachea to
remove offending matter.</p>

<p>474. The <span class='smcaplc'>RESPIRATORY</span> muscles are, in general, attached
at one extremity to the parts about the shoulders, head, and
upper portion of the spinal column. From these, they run
downward and forward, and are attached, at the opposite
extremity, to the sternum, clavicle, and upper rib. Other
muscles are attached at one extremity to a rib above, and by
the opposite extremity to a rib below. These fill the spaces
between the ribs, and, from their situation, are called <i>in-ter-cost&acute;al</i>
muscles.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> 1st. There are several actions of common
occurrence, that are intimately connected with respiration;
such as hiccough, sneezing, &amp;c. Hiccough is an involuntary
contraction of the muscles of respiration, particularly the diaphragm.</p>
<p>2d. Sneezing is a violent, involuntary contraction of the
respiratory muscles, as in hiccough. When an acrid stimulant,
as snuff, is applied to the mucous membrane of the nose,
an irritation is produced which is accompanied by a violent
expulsion of air from the lungs. This is owing to the connection
between the nasal and respiratory nerves.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>475. <span class='smcap'>Respiration</span>, or breathing, is that process by which air
is taken into the lungs and expelled from them. The object of
respiration is, 1st. To supply the system with oxygen, which is
essential to the generation of animal heat; 2d. To convert the
chyle into blood. This is done by the oxygen of the inspired
air; 3d. To relieve the organs of the body of the principal
elements (carbon and hydrogen) that compose the old and
useless particles of matter. The organs of the system, as
already mentioned, are principally composed of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen.</p>
<p>476. By the action of the lymphatics and capillary veins,
the old and worn-out particles are conveyed into the veins of
the systemic circulation. The hydrogen, in form of watery
vapor, is easily discharged in the perspiration and other secretions.
The nitrogen and oxygen are, or may be, separated
from the blood, through the agency of several different organs;
but carbon does not escape so readily. It is probable that a
part of the surplus carbon of the venous blood is secreted by
the liver; but a far greater amount passes to the lungs, and
these may be considered as special organs designed to separate
this element from the venous blood.</p>
<p>477. An ordinary inspiration may be accomplished by the
action of the diaphragm, and a slight elevation of the ribs. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
full inspiration, the diaphragm is not only more depressed
but the ribs are evidently elevated. To produce this effect on
the ribs, two sets of muscles are called into action. Those
which are attached to the upper rib, sternum, and <a name='TC_84'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'cavicle'">clavicle</ins>,
contract and elevate the lower and free extremities of the ribs.
This enlarges the cavity of the chest between the spinal
column and the sternum. But the lateral diameter, in consequence,
is only slightly increased, because the central portion
of the ribs sinks lower than their posterior extremities, or
their cartilaginous attachment to the sternum.</p>
<p class='box'>475&ndash;494. <i>Give the physiology of the respiratory organs.</i> 475. What is
respiration? What is the principal object in breathing? 476. How are

</p>
</div>
<p class='box'>What effect has a full inspiration on the ribs and diaphragm? How is
the chest enlarged between the spinal column and sternum? What is said
of the lateral diameter of the chest? Explain fig.&nbsp;95.</p>
<p>478. The central portion of the ribs is raised by the action
of intercostal muscles. The first, or upper rib, has but little
movement; the second has more motion than the first, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
the third has still more than the second. The second rib is
elevated by the contraction of the muscles between it and the
first. The third rib is raised by the action of two sets of
muscles; one lies between the first and second ribs, the other
between the second and third. The motion of each succeeding
rib is increased, because it is not only acted upon by the
muscles that move the ribs above, but by an additional intercostal;
so that the movement of the twelfth rib is very free,
as it is elevated by the contraction of eleven muscles.</p>
<p>479. The tenth rib is raised eight times as much as the
second rib, and the lateral diameter of the lower portion of the
chest is increased in a corresponding degree. At the same
time, the muscular margin of the diaphragm contracts, which
depresses its central portion; and in this way, the chest is
enlarged forward, laterally, and downward, simultaneously
with the relaxation of the walls of the abdomen.</p>
<p>480. The lungs follow the variations of capacity in the
chest, expanding their air-cells when the latter is enlarged,
and contracting when the chest is diminished. Thus, when
the chest is expanded, the lungs follow, and consequently a
vacuum is produced in their air-cells. The air then rushes
through the mouth and nose into the trachea and its branches,
and fills the vacuum as fast as it is made. This mechanical
process constitutes <i>inspiration</i>.</p>
<p>481. After the expansion of the chest, the muscles that
elevated the ribs relax, together with the diaphragm. The
elasticity of the cartilages of the ribs depresses them,
and the cavity of the chest is diminished, attended by the
expulsion of a portion of the air from the lungs. At the
same time, the muscles that form the front walls of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
abdominal cavity, contract, and press the alimentary canal,
stomach, and liver, upward against the diaphragm; this, being
relaxed, yields to the pressure, rises upward, and presses
upon the lungs, which retreat before it, and another portion
of air is expelled from these organs. This process is called
<i>expiration</i>.</p>
<p class='box'>478. Describe the action of the intercostal muscles upon the ribs.

<p>482. Thus it is obvious that the enlargement of the chest,
or inspiration, is produced in two ways: 1st. By the depression
of the convex portion of the diaphragm; 2d. By the
elevation of the ribs. On the contrary, the contraction of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
chest, or expiration, is produced by the depression of the ribs,
and elevation of the central part of the diaphragm. These
movements are successive during life, and constitute <i>respiration</i>.</p>

<p><i>Experiment.</i> Place the ear upon the chest of a person,
and a murmuring sound will be heard, somewhat like the soft
sighings of the wind through forest trees. This sound is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
caused by the air rushing in and out of the lungs, and is
peculiarly distinct in the child.</p>
<p class='box'>Explain fig.&nbsp;97. How may the murmur of respiration be heard?</p>
<p>483. It is not easy to decide how much air is taken into
the lungs at each inspiration. The quantity, however, must
vary in different individuals, from the difference in the condition
and expansion of the lungs, together with the size of the
chest. From numerous experiments, the quantity, at an
ordinary inspiration, of a common-sized man, is fixed at forty
cubic inches. It has been estimated that one hundred and
seventy cubic inches can be thrown out of the lungs by a forcible
expiration, and that there remain in the lungs two hundred
and twenty cubic inches; so that these organs, in their
quiescent state, may be considered as containing about three
hundred and ninety cubic inches of air, or more than a gallon.</p>
<p>484. Respiration is more frequent in females and children
than in adult men. In diseases, particularly those of the
lungs, it is more increased in frequency than the action of the
heart. In health, the smallest number of inspirations in a
minute by an adult, is not less than fourteen, and they rarely
exceed twenty-five. Eighteen may be considered an average
number. The quantity of oxygen taken into the lungs at
each inspiration is about eight cubic inches, one half of which
disappears in every act of respiration.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Under different circumstances, however, the
consumption of oxygen varies. It is greater when the temperature
is low, than when it is high; and during digestion
the consumption has been found one half greater than when
the stomach was empty.</p>
<p class='box'>483. Can it be ascertained with accuracy how much air is taken into the
lungs at each inspiration? Why not? What is the probable quantity
that an ordinary sized man inspires? How much can be thrown out of
the lungs at a forcible expiration, and how much remains in the lungs?
From these calculations, how much may they contain in their quiescent
state? 484. In whom is respiration most frequent? How in disease?
How in health? How many may be considered an average number?
When is the consumption of oxygen the greatest?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>485. Dr. Southwood Smith has lately performed a series
of very interesting experiments, from which he deduces the
following general results: &ldquo;1st. The volume of air ordinarily
present in the lungs is about twelve pints. 2d. The volume
of air received by the lungs at an ordinary inspiration is one
pint. 3d. The volume of air expelled from the lungs at an
ordinary expiration, is a little less than one pint. 4th. Of the
volume of air received by the lungs at one inspiration, only
one fourth part is decomposed at one action of the heart.
5th. The quantity of blood that flows to the lungs, to be acted
upon by the air at one action of the heart, is two ounces, and
this is acted on in less than one second of time. 6th. The
quantity of blood in the whole body of the human adult, is
twenty-five pounds avoirdupois, or twenty pints. 7th. In the
mutual action that takes place between the air and blood,
every twenty-four hours, the air loses thirty-seven ounces
of oxygen, and the blood fourteen ounces of carbon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>486. Apparently, atmospheric air is a simple element.
But chemical analysis shows its composition to be oxygen and
nitrogen, in the proportion of twenty-one parts of the former,
and about seventy-nine of the latter. In addition, there is a
small amount of vapor of water and <a name='TC_86'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'cabonic'">carbonic</ins> acid. The pressure
of this invisible, elastic fluid upon the body of an ordinary
sized adult, is estimated to equal thirty-five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>487. The principal substance of a vitiated character in the
dark-colored blood is carbonic acid. And since there is no
chemical affinity between the oxygen and nitrogen of the
air, the former readily unites with some of the elements of
the blood. Hence, whenever blood is presented to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
air in the lungs, the oxygen leaves the nitrogen, and becomes
mixed with the circulating fluid. (<a href='#APPENDIX_J'>Appendix J.</a>)</p>
<p class='box'>485. State the 1st, 2d, 3d, and 4th deductions from the experiments of Dr.
Southwood Smith. The 5th, 6th, and 7th. 486. Of what is atmospheric air
composed? What is the weight of air upon a common sized man? 487. What
is the principal substance of a vitiated character in the dark-colored blood?
What is said of the chemical affinity between oxygen and nitrogen?</p>
<p>488. Again, carbonic acid and water have a stronger
affinity for atmospheric air than for the other elements of the
blood. Consequently, when they are brought into contact
with the air in the lungs, the carbonic acid and water leave
the other constituents of the blood, and unite with the air. In
this way the bluish, or impure blood is relieved of its impurities,
and becomes the red, or pure blood, which contains the
principles so essential to life. (<a href='#APPENDIX_K'>Appendix K.</a>)</p>
<p>489. The formation of carbonic acid and water, eliminated
from the system through the lungs and skin, is explained by
the following theory: In the lungs and upon the skin the
oxygen separates from the nitrogen and unites with the blood
in the capillary vessels of these organs. The oxygen is conveyed
with the blood to the capillary arteries and veins of the
different tissues of the system. In these membranes there is
a chemical union of the oxygen with the carbon and hydrogen
contained in the blood and waste atoms of the system. This
combustion, or union of oxygen with carbon and hydrogen, is
attended with the disengagement of heat, and the formation
of carbonic acid and water. (<a href='#APPENDIX_L'>Appendix L.</a>)</p>
<p>490. The following experiment will illustrate the passage
of fluids through membranes, and the different affinity of
gases for each other. Put a mixture of water and alcohol
into a phial and leave it uncorked. Both the water and
alcohol have a greater affinity for air than for each other.
Alcohol has a greater affinity for the air, and will be diffused
through it more readily than the water, when there is no
intervening obstacle. But tie a piece of bladder over the
mouth of the phial, and let it stand a few days,&mdash;the water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
will leave the alcohol, and pass through the membrane. By
the aid of this experiment, we shall endeavor to explain the
interchange of fluids in the lungs.</p>
<p class='box'>488. What is formed when oxygen unites with carbon or hydrogen?
489. Give the theory for the formation of carbonic acid and watery vapor
thrown out of the system. 490. Illustrate the passage of fluids through
membranes, and the different affinities of gases.</p>
<p>491. The walls of the air-vesicles, and coats of the blood-vessels,
are similar, in their mechanical arrangement, to the
membranous bladder in the before described experiment.
As the oxygen of the air has greater affinity for blood than for
nitrogen, so it permeates the membranes that intervene between
the air and blood more readily than the nitrogen.
As the carbonic acid and water have a greater affinity for
air than for the other elements of the blood, so they will also
pass through the walls of the blood-vessels and air-cells more
readily than the other elements of the dark-colored blood.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>492. As the impure blood is passing in the minute vessels
over the air-cells, the oxygen passes through the thin coats of
the air-cells and blood-vessels, and unites with the blood. At
the same time, the carbonic acid and water leave the blood,
and pass through the coats of the blood-vessels and air-cells,
and mix with the air in the cells. These are thrown out of the
system every time we breathe. This interchange of products
produces the change in the color of the blood.</p>

<p>493. The presence of carbonic acid and watery vapor in
the expired air, can be proved by the following experiments:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
1st. Breathe into lime-water, and in a few minutes it will
become of a milk-white color. This is owing to the carbonic
acid of the breath uniting with the lime, forming the <i>carbonate
of lime</i>. 2d. Breathe upon a cold, dry mirror for a
few minutes, and it will be covered with moisture. This is
condensed vapor from the lungs. In warm weather, this
watery vapor is invisible in the expired air, but in a cold, dry
morning in winter, the successive jets of vapor issuing from
the mouth and nose are sufficiently obvious.</p>
<p class='box'>Give the experiment showing that oxygen changes the dark-colored
blood to a bright red color. What is represented by fig.&nbsp;99? 493. How can
the presence of carbonic acid in the lungs be proved?</p>
<p>494. From the lungs are eliminated other impurities beside
carbonic acid, the perceptible quality of which is various
in different persons. The offensive breath of many persons
may be caused by decayed teeth, or the particles of food that
may be retained between them, but it often proceeds from the
secretion, in the lungs, of certain substances which previously
existed in the system.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> When spirituous liquors are taken into the
stomach, they are absorbed by the veins and mixed with the
dark-colored blood, in which they are carried to the lungs to
be expelled from the body. This will explain the fact, which
is familiar to most persons, that the odor of different substances
is perceptible in the breath, or expired air, long after
the mouth is free from these substances.</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>495. <span class='smcap'>For</span> man to enjoy the highest degree of health, it
is necessary that the impure &ldquo;venous&rdquo; blood be properly
changed. As this is effected in the lungs by the action of the
air, it follows that this element, when breathed, should be
pure, or contain twenty-one per cent. of oxygen to about
seventy-nine per cent. of nitrogen.</p>
<p>496. The volume of air expelled from the lungs is somewhat
less than that which is inspired. The amount of loss
varies under different circumstances. An eightieth part of
the volume taken into the lungs, or half a cubic inch, may be
considered an average estimate.</p>
<p>497. <i>The quality and purity of the air is affected by every
respiration.</i> 1st. The quantity of oxygen is diminished.
2d. The amount of carbonic acid is increased. 3d. A certain
proportion of watery vapor is ejected from the lungs in the
expired air. Of the twenty-one parts of oxygen in the
inspired air, only eighteen parts are expired, while the carbonic
acid and watery vapor are increased about four per
cent. The quantity of nitrogen is nearly the same in the
expired as in the inspired air.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is now fully ascertained that while the
chemical composition of the blood is essentially changed, its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
weight remains the same, as the carbon and hydrogen discharged
are equal to the united weight of the oxygen and
nitrogen absorbed.</p>
<p class='box'>495&ndash;546. <i>Give the hygiene of the respiratory organs.</i> 495. What is
necessary that man enjoy the highest degree of health? 496. How does
the volume Of expired air compare with that which was inspired? Does
this loss vary, and what is an average estimate? 497. How is the purity
of the air affected by respiration? How is the inhaled oxygen affected?
What effect on the carbonic acid and watery vapor? On the nitrogen?
What is said respecting the weight of the blood?</p>
<p>498. If one fourth part of the volume of air received by
the lungs at one inspiration is decomposed at one &ldquo;beat&rdquo;
of the heart, it might be supposed that if the expired air be
again received into the lungs, one half of the oxygen would
be consumed, and, in a similar ratio, if re-breathed four times,
all the oxygen would be consumed. But it does not follow, if
the air is thus re-breathed, that the same changes will be
effected in the lungs. For air that has been inspired does
not part with its remaining oxygen as freely as when it contains
the proper amount of this life-giving element, and thus
the changes in the impure blood are not so completely effected.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> In the process of dyeing, each successive
article immersed in the dye weakens it; but it does not
follow that the dye each time is affected in the same degree,
or that the coloring matter by repeated immersions can be
wholly extracted. The same principle applies to the exchange
of oxygen and carbonic acid gas in the lungs.</p>
<p>499. <i>If the inspired air is free from moisture and carbonic
acid, these substances contained in the blood will be more
readily imparted to it.</i> When the air is loaded with vapor, they
are removed more slowly; but if it is saturated with moisture,
no vapor will escape from the blood through the agency of the
lungs. This may be illustrated by the following experiment:
Take two and a half pounds of water, add to it half a pound of
common salt, (chloride of sodium,) and it will readily mix
with the water; and to this solution add the same quantity of
salt, and it will be dissolved more slowly. Again, add more
salt, and it will remain undissolved, as the water has become
saturated by the pound before dissolved.</p>
<p class='box'>498. Does air that is re-breathed freely impart its oxygen? Why?
499. What is the effect on the blood when the air is free from vapor and
carbonic acid? When loaded with vapor? When saturated? How is this
illustrated?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>500. The principle in this experiment is analogous to that
of the union between carbonic gas and atmospheric air.
Allen and Pepy showed by experiment, that air which had
been once breathed, contained eight and a half per cent. of
carbonic acid. They likewise showed, that no continuance of
the respiration of the same air could make it take up more
than ten per cent. This is the point of saturation.</p>
<p><i>Experiment.</i> Sink a glass jar that has a stop-cock, or one
with a glass stopper, into a pail of water, until the air is expelled
from the jar. Fill the lungs with air, and retain it in the
chest a short time, and then breathe into the jar, and instantly
close the stop-cock. Close the opening of the jar that is under
the water with a piece of paper laid on a plate of sufficient
size to cover the opening, invert the jar, and sink into it a
lighted candle. The flame will be extinguished as quickly
as if put in water.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> Remove the carbonic acid by inverting
the jar, and place a lighted candle in it, and the flame will be
as clear as when out of the jar.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. It is familiarly known that a taper will
not burn where carbonic acid exists in any considerable
quantity, or when there is a marked deficiency of oxygen.
From this originated the judicious practice of sinking a lighted
candle into a well or pit before descending into it. If the
flame is extinguished, respiration cannot there be maintained,
and life would be sacrificed should a person venture in, until
the noxious air is removed.</p>
<p class='box'>500. What did the experiments of Allen and Pepy show? How can the
presence of carbonic gas in the expired air be demonstrated? State observation
1st. Observation 2d.</p>
<p>2d. It is the action of carbonic acid upon the respiratory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
organs, that gives rise to a phenomenon frequently seen in
mines and caves. A man may enter these subterranean
rooms, and feel no inconvenience in breathing; but the dog
that follows him, falls apparently dead, and soon dies if not
speedily removed to pure air. This arises from the fact that
this gas is heavier than air, and sinks to the bottom of the
room or cave.</p>
<p>3d. While it is true that carbonic acid possesses properties
that render it unfit to be breathed, it is, notwithstanding,
productive of very agreeable effects, when conveyed into
the stomach. It forms the sparkling property of mineral
waters, and fills the bubbles that rise when beer or cider is
fermenting.</p>
<p>501. <i>Pure atmospheric air is best adapted to a healthy
action of the system.</i> As the air cannot be maintained pure
under all circumstances, the question may be asked, To what
degree may the air be vitiated and still sustain life? and
what is the smallest quantity of pure air a person needs each
minute to maintain good health? Birnan says, that air which
contains more than three and a half per cent. of carbonic
acid is unfit for respiration, and, as air once respired contains
eight and a half per cent. of carbonic acid, it clearly shows
that it is not fitted to be breathed again.</p>
<p>502. No physiologist pretends that less than seven cubic
feet of air are adequate for a man to breathe each minute,
while Dr. Reid allows ten feet. The necessity of fifteen or
twenty times the amount of air actually taken into the lungs,
arises from the circumstance, that the expired air mixes
with and vitiates the surrounding element that has not been
inhaled.</p>
<p>503. <i>The quantity of air which different persons actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
need, varies.</i> The demand is modified by the size, age,
habits, and condition of the body. A person of great size
who has a large quantity of blood, requires more air than a
small man with a less amount of circulating fluid. Individuals
whose labor is active, require more air than sedentary or idle
persons, because the waste of the system is greater. On the
same principle, the gormandizer needs more of this element
than the person of abstemious habits. So does the growing
lad require more air than an adult of the same weight, for
the reason that he consumes more food than a person of
mature years. Habit also exerts a controlling influence. A
man who works in the open air suffers more when placed in
a small, unventilated room, than one who is accustomed to
breathe the confined air of workshops.</p>
<p class='box'>Observation 3d. 501. What questions may be asked respecting the
inspired air? Give the remark of Birnan. 502. How many cubic feet of
air are adequate for a man to breathe each minute? How much does Dr.
Reid allow? 503. Mention some reasons why different persons do not
require the same amount of <a name='TC_90'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">air.</ins></p>
<p>504. <i>Air, in which lamps will not burn with brilliancy, is
unfitted for respiration.</i> In crowded rooms, which are not
ventilated, the air is vitiated, not only by the abstraction of
oxygen and the deposition of carbonic acid, but by the excretions
from the skin and lungs of the audience. The lamps,
under such circumstances, emit but a feeble light. Let the
oxygen gas be more and more expended, and the lamps will
burn more and more feebly, until they are extinguished.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. The effects of breathing the same air
again and again, are well illustrated by an incident that
occurred in one of our halls of learning. A large audience
had assembled in an ill-ventilated room, to listen to a lecture;
soon the lamps burned so dimly that the speaker and audience
were nearly enveloped in darkness. The oppression, dizziness,
and faintness experienced by many of the audience
induced them to leave, and in a few minutes after, the lamps
were observed to rekindle, owing to the exchange of pure air
on opening the door.</p>
<p class='box'>How is it with the laborer? With the gormandizer? With the person
that works in the open air? 504. What effect has impure air on a burning
lamp? Give the illustration of the effects of impure air on lighted <a name='TC_91'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">lamps.</ins></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>2d. In the &ldquo;Black Hole of Calcutta,&rdquo; one hundred and
forty-six Englishmen were shut up in a room eighteen feet
square, with only two small windows on the same side to admit
air. On opening this dungeon, ten hours after their imprisonment,
only twenty-three were alive. The others had died
from breathing impure air.</p>
<p>505. <i>Air that has become impure from the abstraction of
oxygen, an excess of carbonic acid, or the excretions from the
lungs and skin, has a deleterious effect on the body.</i> When
this element is vitiated from the preceding causes, it prevents
the proper arterialization, or change in the blood. For this
reason, pure air should be admitted freely and constantly into
work-shops and dwelling-houses, and the vitiated air permitted
to escape. This is of greater importance than the warming
of these apartments. We can compensate for the deficiency
of a stove, by an extra garment or an increased quantity of
food; but neither garment, exercise, nor food will compensate
for pure air.</p>
<p>506. <i>School-rooms should be ventilated.</i> If they are not,
the pupils will be restless, and complain of languor and headache.
Those unpleasant sensations are caused by a want of
pure air, to give an adequate supply of oxygen to the lungs.
When pupils breathe for a series of years such vitiated air,
their life is undoubtedly shortened, by giving rise to consumption
and other fatal diseases.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A school-room thirty feet square and eight
feet high, contains 7200 cubic feet of air. This room will
seat sixty pupils, and, allowing ten cubic feet of air to each
pupil per minute, all the air in the room will be vitiated in
twelve minutes.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In all school-rooms where there is not adequate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
ventilation, it is advisable to have a recess of five or
ten minutes each hour. During this time, let the pupils
breathe fresh air, and open the doors and windows, so that the
air of the room shall be completely changed.</p>
<p class='box'>Of the effects of breathing impure air. 505. In preserving health, what
is of greater importance than warming the room? 506. Why should a
school-room be ventilated? Give the illustration.</p>
<p>507. <i>Churches, concert halls, and all rooms designed for
a collection of individuals, should be amply ventilated.</i> While
the architect and workmen are assiduous in giving these public
rooms architectural beauty and splendor, by adorning the
ceiling with Gothic tracery, rearing richly carved columns,
and providing carefully for the warming of the room, it too
frequently happens that no direct provision is made for the
change of that element which gives us beauty, strength,
and life.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A hall sixty feet by forty, and fifteen feet
high, contains 36,000 cubic feet of air. A hall of this size
will seat four hundred persons; by allowing ten cubic feet of
air to each person per minute, the air of the room will be
rendered unfit for respiration in nine minutes.</p>
<p>508. <i>Railroad cars, cabins of steam and canal-boats, omnibuses,
and stage-coaches, require ample ventilation.</i> In the
construction of these public conveyances, too frequently, the
only apparent design is, to seat the greatest number of persons,
regardless of the quantity and character of the air to maintain
health and even life. The character of the air is only realized
when, from the fresh, pure air, we enter a crowded cabin of
a boat or a closed coach; then the vitiated air from animal
excretions and noxious gases is offensive, and frequently produces
sickness.</p>
<p>509. The influence of habit is strikingly expressed by
Birnan, in the &ldquo;Art of Warming and Ventilating Rooms:&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not the least remarkable example of the power of habit is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
its reconciling us to practices which, but for its influence,
would be considered noxious and disgusting. We instinctively
shun approach to the dirty, the squalid, and the diseased, and
use no garment that may have been worn by another. We
open sewers for matters that offend the sight or the smell, and
contaminate the air. We carefully remove impurities from
what we eat and drink, filter turbid water, and fastidiously
avoid drinking from a cup that may have been pressed to the
lips of a friend. On the other hand, we resort to places of
assembly, and draw into our mouths air loaded with effluvia
from the lungs, skin, and clothing of every individual in the
promiscuous crowd&mdash;exhalations offensive, to a certain extent,
from the most healthy individuals; but when arising from a
living mass of skin and lungs, in all stages of evaporation,
disease, and putridity,&mdash;prevented by the walls and ceiling
from escaping&mdash;they are, when thus concentrated, in the
highest degree deleterious and loathsome.&rdquo;</p>

said in regard to ventilating churches, concert halls, &amp;c.? State the

the influence of habit by Birnan.</p>
<p>510. <i>The sleeping-room should be so ventilated that the air
in the morning will be as pure as when retiring to rest in the
evening.</i> Ventilation of the room would prevent morning
headaches, the want of appetite, and languor&mdash;so common
among the feeble. The impure air of sleeping-rooms probably
causes more deaths than intemperance. Look around the
country, and those who are most exposed, who live in huts
but little superior to the sheds that shelter the farmer&rsquo;s flocks,
are found to be the most healthy and robust. Headaches, liver
complaints, coughs, and a multitude of nervous affections, are
almost unknown to them; not so with those who spend their
days and nights in rooms in which the sashes of the windows
are calked, or perchance doubled, to prevent the keen but
healthy air of winter from entering their apartments. Disease
and suffering are their constant companions.</p>
<p class='box'>510. What is said of the ventilation of sleeping-rooms? What would
adequate ventilation prevent? Give a common observation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> By many, sleeping apartments twelve feet
square and seven feet high, are considered spacious for two
persons, and good accommodations for four to lodge in. An
apartment of this size contains 1008 cubic feet of air. Allowing
ten cubic feet to each person per minute, two occupants
would vitiate the air of the room in fifty minutes, and four in
twenty-five minutes. When lodging-rooms are not ventilated,
we would strongly recommend early rising.</p>
<p>511. <i>The sick-room, particularly, should be so arranged
that the impure air may escape, and pure air be constantly admitted
into the room.</i> It is no unusual practice in some communities,
when a child or an adult is sick of an acute disease,
to prevent the ingress of pure air, simply from the apprehension
of the attendants, that the patient will contract a cold.
Again, the prevalent custom of several individuals sitting in
the sick-room, particularly when they remain there for several
hours, tends to vitiate the air, and, consequently, to increase
the suffering and danger of the sick person. In fevers or
inflammatory diseases of any kind, let the patient breathe
pure air; for the purer the blood, the greater the power of the
system to remove disease, and the less the liability to contract
colds.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Among children, convulsions, or &ldquo;fits,&rdquo; usually
occur when they are sleeping. In many instances, these
are produced by the impure air which is breathed. To prevent
these alarming and distressing convulsions, the sleeping-room
should be ventilated, and there should be no curtains
around the bed, or coverings over the face, as they produce
an effect similar to that experienced when sleeping in a small,
unventilated room. To relieve a child when convulsed, carry
it into the open air.</p>
<p class='box'>What is said of the size of sleeping-rooms? 511. What is said of the
sick-room? Mention some prevailing customs in reference to these
rooms. What is said of convulsions among children?</p>
<p>512. <i>While occupying a room, we are insensible of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
gradual vitiation of the air.</i> This is the result of the diminished
sensibility of the nervous system, and gradual adaptation
of the organs to blood of a less stimulating character. This
condition is well illustrated in the hibernating animals. We
are insensible of the impure air of unventilated sleeping-rooms,
until we leave them for a walk or ride. If they have been
closed, we are made sensible of the character of the air as
soon as we re&euml;nter them, for the system has regained its usual
sensibility while inhaling a purer atmosphere.</p>
<p>513. <i>In the construction of every inhabited room, there
should be adequate means of ventilation, as well as warming.</i>
No room is well ventilated, unless as much pure air is brought
into it as the occupants vitiate at every respiration. This can
be effected by making an aperture in the ceiling of the room,
or by constructing a ventilating flue in the chimney. This
should be in contact with the flues for the escape of smoke,
but separated from them by a thin brick partition. The hot
air in the smoke flues will warm the separating brick partition,
and consequently rarefy the air in the ventilating flue. Communication
from every room in a house should be had to such
flues. The draught of air can be regulated by well-adjusted
registers, which in large rooms should be placed near the floor
as well as near the ceiling.</p>
<p>514. While provision is made for the escape of rarefied
impure air, we should also provide means by which pure air
may be constantly admitted into the room, as the crevices of
the doors and windows are not always sufficient; and, if they
should be adequate, air can be introduced in a more convenient,
economical, and appropriate manner. There should be
an aperture opposite the ventilating flue, at or near the floor,
to connect with the outer walls of the building or external <a name='TC_92'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">air.</ins>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
But if pure heated air is introduced into the room, it obviates
the necessity of the introduction of the external air.<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a></p>
<p class='box'>512. Why are we insensible to the gradual vitiation of the air of an unventilated
room? 513. What is very important in the building of every
inhabited room? How can a room be well ventilated? 514. What is said
relative to a communication with the external air?</p>
<p>515. In warming rooms, the hot air furnaces, or box and
air-tight stoves converted into hot air furnaces, should be
used in preference to the ordinary stoves. The air thus introduced
into the room is pure as well as warm. In the adaptation
of furnaces to dwelling-houses, &amp;c., it is necessary that
the air should pass over an ample surface of iron moderately
heated; as a red heat abstracts the oxygen from the contiguous
air, and thus renders it unfit to be respired.<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a></p>
<p><i>Observation</i>. Domestic animals need a supply of pure air
as well as man. The cows of cities, that breathe a vitiated
air, have, very generally, tubercles. Sheep that are shut in
a confined air, die of a disease called the &ldquo;rot,&rdquo; which is of
a tuberculous character. Interest and humanity require that
the buildings for animals be properly ventilated.</p>

<p>516. <span class='smcap'>The</span> change that is effected in the blood while passing
through the lungs, not only depends upon the purity of the
air, but the amount inspired. The quantity varies according
to the size of the chest, and the movement of the ribs and
diaphragm.</p>
<p>517. <i>The size of the chest and lungs can be reduced by
moderate and continued pressure.</i> This is most easily done
in infancy, when the cartilages and ribs are very pliant; yet
it can be effected at more advanced periods of life, even after
the chest is fully developed. For want of knowledge of the
pliant character of the cartilages and ribs in infants, too many
mothers, unintentionally, contract their chests, and thus sow
the seeds of disease by the close dressing of their offspring.</p>
<p>518. If slight but steady pressure be continued from day
to day and from week to week, the ribs will continue to yield
more and more, and after the expiration of a few months,
the chest will become diminished in size. This will be
effected without any suffering of a marked character; but
the general health and strength will be impaired. It is not
the violent and ephemeral pressure, but the moderate and
protracted, that produces the miscalled, &ldquo;genteel,&rdquo; contracted
chests.</p>
<p>519. The style of dress which at the present day is almost
universal, is a prolific cause of this deformity. These baneful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
fashions are copied from the periodicals, so widely circulated,
containing a &ldquo;fashion plate of the latest fashions,
from Paris.&rdquo; In every instance; the contracted, deformed,
and, as it is called, lady-like waist, is portrayed in all its
fascinating loveliness. These periodicals are found on almost
every centre-table, and exercise an influence almost omnipotent.

by civil legislation, with the same propriety ought not those to
be suppressed that have a tendency so adverse to health?</p>

<p>2d. The American women <i>compress their chests</i>, to prevent
their growth; so that the chest of an <i>American belle</i> is not
larger than the chest of a Chinese girl of five years. Which
country, in this respect, exhibits the greater intelligence?</p>
<p>3d. The chest can be deformed by making the linings of
the waists of the dresses tight, as well as by corsets. Tight
vests, upon the same principle, are also injurious.</p>
<p>520. In children, who have never worn close garments,
the circumference of the chest is generally about equal to that
of the body at the hips; and similar proportions would exist
through life, if there were no improper pressure of the
clothing. This is true of the laboring women of the Emerald
Isle, and other countries of Europe, and in the Indian female,
whose blanket allows the free expansion of the chest. The
symmetrical statues of ancient sculptors bear little resemblance
to the &ldquo;beau ideal&rdquo; of American notions of elegant
form. This perverted taste is in opposition to the laws of
nature. The design of the human chest is not simply to
connect the upper and lower portions of the body, like some
insects, but to form a case for the protection of the vital
organs.</p>
<p>521. <i>Individuals may have small chests from birth.</i> This,
to the particular individual, is natural; yet it is adverse to the
great and general law of Nature relative to the size of the
human chest. Like produces like, is a general law of the
animal and vegetable kingdoms. No fact is better established,
than that which proves the hereditary transmission
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
from parents to children of a constitutional liability to disease
and the same may be said in regard to their conformations.
If the mother has a small, taper waist, either hereditary or
acquired, this form may be impressed on her offspring;&mdash;thus
illustrating the truthfulness of scripture, &ldquo;that the sins of the
parents shall be visited upon the children unto the third and
fourth generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>Observation 2d. Observation 3d. 520. What is the size of the chest of
a child that has always worn loose clothing? What is said of the size of
the laboring women of Ireland, and the Indian female? How is it in
ancient statues? What is the design of the chest? 521. What is a general
law of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms? What fact in this
connection is well established?</p>
<p>522. <i>The quantity of air inhaled is modified by the capacity
of the respiratory organs.</i> The necessity of voluminous
lungs may he elucidated by the following experiment: Suppose
a gill of alcohol, mixed with a gill of water, be put into
a vessel having a square foot of surface, and over the vessel
a membrane be tied, and that the water will evaporate in
twenty-four hours. If the surface had been only six inches
square, only one fourth of the water would have evaporated
through the membrane in the given time. If the surface had
been extended to two square feet, the water would have evaporated
in twelve hours.</p>
<p>523. Apply this principle to the lungs: suppose there are
two hundred feet of carbonic acid to be carried out of the
system every twenty-four hours. This gas, in that time, will
pass through a vesicular membrane of two thousand square
feet. If the lungs were diminished in size, so that there would
be only one thousand square feet of vesicular membrane, the
amount of carbonic acid would not, and could not, be eliminated
from the system. Under such circumstances, the blood would
not be purified.</p>
<p>524. Again; suppose the two thousand square feet of
membrane would transmit two hundred cubic feet of oxygen
into the system every twenty-four hours. If it should be
diminished one half, this amount of oxygen would not pass
into the blood. From the above illustrations we may learn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
the importance of well-developed chests and voluminous
lungs; for, by increasing the size of the lungs, the oxygen is
more abundantly supplied to the blood, and this fluid is more
perfectly deprived of its carbon and hydrogen.</p>
<p class='box'>What does this hereditary transmission prove? 522. How is the
necessity of voluminous lungs illustrated? 525. How is this principle
applied to the interchange of products in the lungs?</p>
<p>525. The chest is not only most expanded at its lower
part, but the portion of the lungs that occupies this space of
the thoracic cavity contains the greater part of the air-cells;
and, from the lower two thirds of the lungs the greatest
amount of carbonic acid is abstracted from the blood, and
the greatest amount of oxygen gas is conveyed into the circulating
fluid. Hence, contracting the lower ribs is far more
injurious to the health than diminishing the size of the upper
part of the chest.</p>
<p>526. The question is often asked, Can the size of the chest
and the volume of the lungs be increased, when they have
been injudiciously compressed, or have inherited this unnatural
form? The answer is in the affirmative. The means
for attaining this end are, a judicious exercise of the lungs,
by walking in the open air, reading aloud, singing, sitting erect,
and fully inflating the lungs at each act of inspiration. If the
exercise be properly managed and persevered in, it will
expand the chest, and give tone and health to the important
organs contained in it. But, if the exercise be ill-timed or
carried to excess, the beneficial results sought will probably
not be attained.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Scholars, and persons who sit much of the
time, should frequently, during the day, breathe full and
deep, so that the smallest air-cells may be fully filled with
air. While exercising the lungs, the shoulders should be
thrown back and the head held erect.</p>
<p>527. <i>The movement of the ribs and diaphragm is modified
by the dress.</i> When the lungs are properly filled with air,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the chest is enlarged in every direction. If any article of
apparel is worn so tight as to prevent the full expansion of
the chest and abdomen, the lungs, in consequence, do not
receive air sufficient to purify the blood. The effect of firm,
unyielding clothing, when worn tight, in preventing a due
supply of air to the lungs, may be shown by the following
illustration.</p>
<p class='box'>525. Why is it more injurious to contract the lower part of the chest than
the upper? 526. How can the size of the chest be increased when it is
contracted? Give the observation. 527. How is the movement of the
ribs and diaphragm modified?</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> If the diameter of a circle is three feet, the
circumference will be nine feet. If the diameter is extended
to four feet, the circumference will be increased to twelve
feet. Should a tight band be thrown around a circle of nine
feet, its diameter cannot be increased, for the circumference
cannot be enlarged.</p>
<p>528. Any inelastic band, drawn closely around the lower
part of the chest, or the abdomen, below the ribs, operates
like the band in the preceding illustration, in restricting the
movement of the ribs. When any article of dress encircles
either the chest or abdomen, so as to prevent an increase of
its circumference, it has an injudicious tendency, as it prevents
the introduction of air in sufficient quantities to purify
the blood. The question is not, How much restriction
of the respiratory movements can be endured, and life continue?
but, Does any part of the apparel restrict the movements?
If it does, it is a violation of the organic laws; and
though Nature is profuse in her expenditures, yet sooner or
later, she sums up her account.</p>
<p>529. In determining whether the apparel is worn too tight,
inflate the lungs, and, if no pressure is felt, no injurious effects
need be apprehended from this cause. In testing the tightness
of the dress, some persons will contract to the utmost
the abdominal muscles, and thus diminish the size of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
chest, by depressing the ribs; when this is done, the individual
exclaims, &ldquo;How loose my dress is!&rdquo; This practice
is both deceptive and ludicrous. A good test is, to put the
hand on the chest below the arm; if there is no movement of
the ribs during respiration, the apparel is too tight. The only
reliable test, however, is a full inflation of the lungs.</p>
<p class='box'>How is the effect of unyielding clothing, when worn tight, illustrated?
528. What effect has an inelastic band upon the lower part of the chest?
What question is asked? 529. How can we determine whether the apparel
is worn too tight?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Many individuals do not realize the small
amount of force that will prevent the enlargement of the
chest. This can be demonstrated by drawing a piece of tape
tightly around the lower part of the chest of a vigorous adult,
and confining it with the thumb and finger. Then endeavor
fully to inflate the lungs, and the movement of the ribs will
be much restricted.</p>
<p>530. <i>The position in standing and sitting influences the
movement of the ribs and diaphragm.</i> When the shoulders
are thrown back, and when a person stands or sits erect, the
diaphragm and ribs have more freedom of motion, and the
abdominal muscles act more efficiently; thus the lungs have
broader range of movement than when the shoulders incline
forward, and the body is stooping.</p>
<p>531. <i>Habit exercises an influence upon the range of the
respiratory movements.</i> A person who has been habituated to
dress loosely, and whose inspirations are full and free, suffers
more from the tightness of a vest or waistband, than one, the
range of movements of whose chest has long been subjected
to tight lacing.</p>
<p>532. <i>The condition of the brain exercises a great influence
upon respiration.</i> If the brain is diseased, or the mind
depressed by grief, tormented by anxiety, or absorbed by
abstract thought, the contractile energy of the diaphragm and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
muscles that elevate the ribs, is much diminished, and the
lungs are not so fully inflated, as when the mind is influenced
by joy or other exhilarating emotions. The depressing passions
likewise lessen the frequency of respiration. By the
influence of these causes, the blood is but partially purified,
and the whole system becomes enfeebled. Here we may
see the admirable harmony between the different parts of
the body, and the adaptation of all the functions to each
other.</p>
<p class='box'>Give another test. How can the amount of pressure necessary to prevent
the enlargement of the chest be demonstrated? 530. Show the
effect of position on the movements of the ribs and diaphragm. 531. Show
the effect of habit on the respiratory movements. 532. State the influence
of the mind upon respiration.</p>
<p>533. As the quantity of air inhaled at each unimpeded
inspiration in lungs of ample size, is about forty cubic inches,
it follows, if the movement of the ribs and diaphragm is
restricted by an enfeebled action of the respiratory muscles,
or by any other means, the blood will not be perfectly purified.
In the experiment, (&sect;&nbsp;522, 523,) suppose forty cubic inches of
air must pass over the membrane twenty times every minute,
and that this is the amount required to remove the vapor
which arises from the membrane; if only half of this amount
of air be supplied each minute, only one half as much water
will be removed from the alcohol through the membrane in
twenty-four hours; consequently, the alcohol would be impure
from the water not being entirely removed.</p>
<p>534. Restrain the elevation of the ribs and depression of
the diaphragm, so that the quantity of air conveyed into the
lungs will be reduced to twenty cubic inches, when forty are
needed, and the results will be as follows: Only one half of
the carbonic acid will be eliminated from the system, and the
blood will receive but one half as much oxygen as it requires.
This fluid will then be imperfectly oxydated, and partially
freed of its impurities. The impure blood will be returned
to the left side of the heart, and the whole system will suffer
from an infringement of organic laws.</p>
<p class='box'>533. Illustrate the effect upon the blood when the respiratory muscles
are enfeebled in their action. 534. Show how the blood is imperfectly
purified by restricting the movements of the ribs and diaphragm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>535. <i>Scrofula, or consumption, frequently succeeds a depressed
state of the nervous system.</i> These diseases arise
from the deposition of tuberculous matter in different parts of
the body. Those individuals who have met with reverses of
fortune, in which character and property were lost, afford painful
examples. Hundreds yearly die from the effect of depressed
spirits, caused by disappointed hopes, or disappointed ambition.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A striking instance of the effects of mental
depression is related by L&aelig;nnec. In a female religious
establishment in France, great austerities were practised; the
mind was absorbed in contemplating the terrible truths of
religion, and in mortifying the flesh. The whole establishment,
in the space of ten years, was several times depopulated&mdash;with
the exception of the persons employed at the
gate, in the kitchen, and garden&mdash;with that fatal disease,
consumption. This institution did not long continue, but was
suppressed by order of the French government.</p>
<p>536. <i>The purity of the blood is influenced by the condition
of the lungs.</i> When the bronchial tubes and air-cells have
become partially impervious to air, from pressure upon the
lungs, from fluids in the chest, from tumors, or from the consolidation
of the cells and tubes from disease,&mdash;as inflammation,
or the deposition of yellow, cheesy matter, called
tubercles,&mdash;the blood will not be purified, even if the air is
pure, the lungs voluminous, and the respiratory movements
unrestricted, as the air cannot permeate the air-cells.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The twenty-three who escaped immediate
death in the Black Hole of Calcutta were soon attacked
with inflammation of the lungs, by which these organs were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
consolidated, and thus prevented the permeation of air into
their cells. This disease of the lungs was caused by breathing
vitiated air.</p>
<p class='box'>535. Mention some of the effects of mental depression upon the <a name='TC_94'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">body.</ins>
What is related by L&aelig;nnec? 536. Does the condition of the lungs
influence the purity of the blood? Mention some of the conditions that
will impede the oxydation of blood in the lungs. What occurred to those
persons who escaped death in the Black Hole of Calcutta?</p>
<p>2d. One of the precursory symptoms of consumption is the
feeble murmur of respiration in the upper part of the lungs.
This condition of these organs is produced by, or frequently
follows, mental depression, the breathing of impure air, the
stooping position in standing or sitting, and the restriction of
the movements of the ribs and diaphragm.</p>
<p>3d. Persons asphyxiated by carbonic acid, water, strangling,
or any noxious air, after resuscitation, are usually affected
with coughs and other diseases of the lungs.</p>
<p>537. <span class='smcap'>Colds</span> and <span class='smcaplc'>COUGHS</span> are generally induced by a chill,
that produces a contraction of the blood-vessels of the skin;
and the waste material, which should be carried from the
body by the agency of the vessels of this membrane, is
retained in the system, and a great portion of it is returned to
the mucous membrane of the lungs. For such is the harmony
established by the Creator, that if the function of any portion
of the body is deranged, those organs whose offices are similar
take on an increased action.</p>
<p>538. The waste material, that should have passed through
the many outlets of the skin, creates an unusual fulness of
the minute vessels that nourish the mucous membrane of the
bronchia; this induces an irritation of these vessels, which
increases the flow of blood to the nutrient arteries of the lungs.
There is, also, a thickening of the lining membrane of the
lungs, caused by the repletion of the bronchial vessels of the
mucous membrane; this impedes the passage of air through
the small bronchial tubes, and consequently the air-vesicles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
cannot impart a sufficient quantity of oxygen to purify the
blood, and this fluid, imperfectly purified, does not pass with
facility through the lungs. An additional obstacle to the free
passage of air into the lungs, is the accumulation of blood in
the pulmonary vessels.</p>
<p class='box'>What is one of the precursory symptoms of consumption? How is this
condition frequently produced? What diseases usually follow asphyxia by
carbonic acid, water, strangling, &amp;c.? 537. How are colds generally induced?
538. What effect has a common cold upon the mucous membrane
of the lungs?</p>
<p>539. As colds and coughs are very generally treated by the
&ldquo;matrons&rdquo; of the community, or by the patient, the following
suggestions may aid in directing a proper treatment: To
effect a speedy cure, it is necessary to diminish the amount of
fluid in the vessels of the lungs. This can be effected in two
ways: 1st. By diminishing the quantity of blood in the system;
2d. By diverting it from the lungs to the skin. The
first condition can be easily and safely affected, by abstaining
from food, and drinking no more than a gill of fluid in twenty-four
hours. As there is a continuous waste from the skin
and other organs of the system, the quantity of blood by this
procedure will be diminished, and the lungs relieved of the
accumulated fluid.</p>
<p>540. The second condition can be accomplished by resorting
to the warm or vapor bath. These and the common
sweats will invite the blood from the lungs to the skin. By
keeping up the action of the skin for a few hours, the lungs
will be relieved. In some instances, emetics and cathartics
are necessary; mucilages, as gum arabic or slippery-elm
bark, would be good. After the system is relieved, the skin
is more impressible to cold, and consequently requires careful
protection by clothing. In good constitutions, the first
method is preferable, and generally sufficient without any
medicine or &ldquo;sweating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>541. <i>The method of resuscitating persons apparently
drowned.</i> In the first instance, it is necessary to press the
chest, suddenly and forcibly, downward and backward, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
instantly discontinue the pressure. Repeat this without intermission,
until a pair of bellows can be procured. When the
bellows are obtained, introduce the nozzle well upon the base
of the tongue, and surround the mouth and nose with a towel
or handkerchief, to close them. Let another person press
upon the projecting part of the neck, called &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s <a name='TC_95'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was single-quote">apple,&rdquo;</ins>
while air is introduced into the lungs through the bellows.
Then press upon the chest, to force the air from the lungs, to
imitate natural breathing. (<a href='#APPENDIX_M'>Appendix M.</a>)</p>
<p class='box'>539. Give the first method for the treatment of cold. 540. The second
method. 541, 542. How should persons apparently drowned be treated?</p>
<p>542. Continue the use of the bellows, and forcing the air
out of the chest, for an hour at least, unless signs of natural
breathing come on. Wrap the body in warm, dry blankets,
and place it near the fire, to preserve the natural warmth, as
well as to impart artificial heat. Every thing, however, is
secondary to filling the lungs with air. Avoid all friction
until breathing is restored. Send immediately for medical aid.</p>
<p>543. <i>The means of resuscitating persons asphyxiated from
electricity, &amp;c.</i> In apparent death from electricity, (lightning,)
the person is frequently asphyxiated from <i>pa-ral&acute;y-sis</i>
(palsy) of the respiratory muscles. To recover such persons,
resort to artificial respiration. In cases of apparent death
from hanging or strangling, the knot should be untied or cut
immediately; then use artificial respiration, or breathing, as
directed in apparent death from drowning.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is an impression, in many sections of the
country, that the law will not allow the removal of the cord
from the neck of a body found suspended, unless the coroner
be present. It is therefore proper to say, that no such delay
is necessary, and that no time should be lost in attempting
to resuscitate the strangled person.</p>
<p>544. <i>The method of resuscitating persons apparently dead
from inhaling carbonic acid gas.</i> When life is apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
extinct from breathing carbonic acid gas, the person should
be carried into the open air. The head and shoulders should
be slightly elevated; the face and chest should be sponged or
sprinkled with cold water, or cold vinegar and water, while the
limbs are wrapped in dry, warm blankets. In this, as in
asphyxia from other causes, immediately resort to artificial
respiration.</p>
<p class='box'>543. What treatment should be adopted in asphyxia from electricity?
From hanging? 544. What should be the treatment in asphyxia from
inhaling carbonic acid gas?</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Many persons have died from breathing
carbonic acid that was formed by burning charcoal in an open
pan or portable furnace, for the purpose of warming their,
sleeping-rooms. This is not only produced by burning charcoal,
but is evolved from the live coals of a wood fire; and
being heavier than air, it settles on the floor of the room; and,
if there is no open door or chimney-draught, it will accumulate,
and, rising above the head of an individual, will cause
asphyxia or death.</p>
<p>2d. In resuscitating persons apparently dead from causes
already mentioned, if a pair of bellows cannot be procured
immediately, let their lungs be inflated by air expelled from
the lungs of some person present. To have the expired air
as pure as possible, the person should quickly inflate his
lungs, and instantly expel the air into those of the asphyxiated
person. <i>Place the patient in pure air, admit attendants
only into the apartment, and send for a physician without
delay.</i></p>
<p class='box'>What sad results frequently follow the burning of charcoal in a closed
room? What suggestion in resuscitating asphyxiated persons?</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXVII_ANIMAL_HEAT' id='CHAPTER_XXVII_ANIMAL_HEAT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>ANIMAL HEAT.</h3>
</div>
<p>545. <span class='smcap'>The</span> true sources of animal heat, or calorification, are
still imperfectly known. No hypothesis has, as yet, received
the concurrent assent of physiologists. We see certain phenomena,
but the ultimate causes are hidden from our view.
Its regular production, to a certain degree, is essential both
to animal and vegetable life.</p>
<p>546. There is a tendency between bodies of different temperature
to an equilibrium of heat. Thus, if we touch or
approach a hot body, the heat, or caloric passes from that
body to our organs of feeling, and gives the sensation of heat.
On the contrary, when we touch a cold body, the heat passes
from the hand to that body, and causes a sensation of cold.</p>
<p>547. The greater number of animals appear cold when
we touch them; and, indeed, the temperature of their bodies
is not much above that of the atmosphere, and changes with
it. In man, and other animals that approach him in their
organization, it is otherwise. They have the faculty of producing
a sufficient quantity of caloric to maintain their temperatures
nearly at the same degree, under all atmospheric
changes, and keep themselves warm.</p>
<p>548. Those animals whose proper heat is not very perceivable,
are called <i>cold</i>-blooded; as most species of fishes,
toads, snakes, turtles, and reptiles generally. Those animals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
which produce sufficient heat independently of the atmosphere
surrounding them, are called <i>warm</i>-blooded; as man, birds,
quadrupeds, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='box'>545&ndash;570. <i>What is said respecting animal heat?</i> 545. Are the true sources
of animal heat known? What do we see? 546. What is the tendency
between bodies of different temperatures? Give an explanation. 547. What
is said of the temperature of animals? 548. What is meant by cold-blooded
animals? By warm-blooded animals?</p>
<p>549. The temperature of man is about 98&deg;, (Fahrenheit&rsquo;s
thermometer,) and that of some other animals is higher; the
temperature of birds, for example, is about 110&deg;. It is obvious,
that in most parts of the globe, the heat of the atmosphere
is, even in summer, less than that of the human body.
In our latitude, the mercury rarely attains 98&deg;, and sometimes
it descends to several degrees below zero.</p>
<p>550. Captain Parry, with his ship&rsquo;s company, in his voyage
of discovery to the arctic regions, wintered in a climate where
the mercury was at 40&deg;, and sometimes at 55&deg; below zero.
Captain Back found it 70&deg; below zero. These were 72&deg; and
102&deg; below the freezing point, or about 200&deg; below that of
their own bodies, and still they were able to resist this low
temperature, and escape being &ldquo;frost-bitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>551. Captain Lyon, who accompanied Captain Parry in his
second voyage to the northern regions, found the temperature
of an arctic fox to be 106&deg;, while that of the atmosphere
was 32&deg; below zero; making a difference between the temperature
of the fox and that of the atmosphere, of 138&deg;. Captain
Scoresby found the temperature of a whale, in the Arctic
Ocean, to be 104&deg;, or nearly as high as that of other animals
of the same kind in the region of the equator, while the temperature
of the ice was as low as 32&deg;, and the water was
nearly as cold. These facts show what a strong counteracting
energy there is in animals against the effects of cold.</p>
<p>552. On the other hand, it has been ascertained by numerous
and well-conducted experiments, that the human body can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
be exposed, even for a length of time, to a very high temperature,
without essentially elevating that of the body. Chantrey,
the sculptor, often entered the furnace, heated for drying
his moulds, when the temperature indicated by the thermometer
was 330&deg;. Chaubert, the Fire-King, is said to have
entered ovens when heated to 600&deg;. In 1774, Sir Charles
Blagden entered a room in which the mercury rose to 260&deg;.
He remained eight minutes without suffering.</p>
<p class='box'>549. What is the temperature of the human body? Of birds? How
does the heat of the atmosphere in summer, in our latitude, compare with
that of the human system? 550. What is related of Captain Parry? Of
Captain Back? 551. Of Captain Lyon? Of Captain Scoresby? What do
these facts show? 552. What has been ascertained on the other hand?</p>
<p>553. In order to render it certain that there was no fallacy,
says Sir Charles Blagden, &ldquo;in the degree of heat shown by
the thermometer, but that the air breathed was capable of
producing all the well-known effects of such a heat on inanimate
matter, I put some eggs and beefsteak upon a tin frame
placed near the thermometer, and farther distant from the
cockle than from the wall of the room. In about twenty minutes
the eggs were taken out, roasted quite hard; and in forty-seven
minutes, the steak was not only dressed, but almost
dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>554. If a thermometer be placed under the tongue of a
healthy person, in all climates and seasons the temperature
will be found nearly the same. Sir Charles Blagden, &ldquo;while
in the heated room, breathed on a thermometer, and the
mercury sank several degrees; and when he expired forcibly,
the air felt cool as it passed through the nostrils, though it was
scorching hot when it entered them in inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Did not the human body possess within itself
the power of generating and removing heat, so as to maintain
nearly an equality of temperature, the most fatal consequences
would ensue. In northern latitudes, especially, in severe
weather of winter, the blood would be converted into a solid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
mass, and on the other hand, the fatty secretion, when subjected
to equatorial heat, would become fluid, and life would
be extinguished.</p>
<p class='box'>What is related of Chantrey? Of Chaubert? Of Sir Charles Blagden?
553. Give Sir Charles&rsquo;s own statement. 554. What is said of the temperature
of the human tongue? Mention the experiment by Sir Charles
Blagden. What would be the effect if the human system did not maintain
an equality of temperature?</p>
<p>555. To enable man, and other warm-blooded animals, to
maintain this equilibrium of temperature under such extremes
of heat and cold, naturally suggests two inquiries: 1st. By
what organs is animal heat generated? 2d. By what means
is its uniformity maintained?</p>
<p>556. The ancients had no well-arranged theory on the subject
of animal heat. They believed that the chief object of
respiration was to cool the blood, and that the heart was the
great furnace where all the heat was generated. At a later
period, Mayow, from his discoveries respecting respiration,
asserted that the object of respiration was to produce heat,
and denied that the blood was cooled in the lungs.</p>
<p>557. When it was discovered that, both in combustion and
respiration, carbonic acid was produced and oxygen absorbed,
it led Dr. Black to conclude that breathing was a kind of
combustion by which all the heat of the body was produced.
This theory was objected to, because, if all the heat was generated
in the lungs, like those parts of a stove in contact
with the fuel, they would be at a higher temperature than those
parts at a distance, which was known not to exist.</p>
<p>558. The next theory, and one which received the sanction
of the scientific men of Europe, was proposed by Dr. Crawford.
He agreed with Dr. Black that heat not only was
generated in the lungs, but that the arterial blood had a greater
capacity for heat than the venous, and that this increase of
capacity takes place in the lungs. At the moment heat is
generated, a portion of it, under the name of latent heat, is
absorbed and conveyed to the different parts of the body
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
Wherever arterial blood is converted into venous, this latent
heat is given out. But, unfortunately for this theory, Dr. Davy
proved the capacity of both, for heat, to be nearly the same.</p>
<p class='box'>555. What inquiries are naturally suggested? 556. What was the theory
of the ancients? What did Mayow assert at a later period? 557. What
was the theory of Dr. Black? The objection? 558. What was the theory
of Dr Crawford?</p>
<p>559. No one can doubt that respiration and animal heat
are closely connected. Those animals whose respiratory
apparatus is the most extended, have the highest temperature.
An example is seen in birds, whose organs of respiration
extend over a large part of the body, and their temperature
is 12&deg; above man; while the respiratory apparatus of cold-blooded
animals, as some kinds of fish, is imperfect, and only
a small quantity of blood is subjected, at any time, to the
effects of respiration.</p>
<p>560. To understand the process by which heat is generated
in the human system and in animals, it will be necessary to
state: 1st. That the apparent heat of a body, as perceived
by the touch, or as indicated by a thermometer, is not the
measurement of heat contained in the body, or its capacity
for heat.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> If we mix one pound of water, at the temperature
of 60&deg;, with another pound at 91&deg;, the resulting temperature
will be exactly the medium, or 75&frac12;&deg;. But, if we mix a
pound of water at 60&deg; with a pound of quicksilver at 91&deg;, the
resulting temperature will be only 61&deg;, because the capacity
of water for heat is so much greater than that of quicksilver,
that the heat which raised the quicksilver 31&deg; will raise the
water only 1&deg;.</p>
<p>561. 2d. When the density and the arrangement of the
atoms of a body are changed, its capacity to hold heat in a
latent state is altered. If it will retain more, heat will be
absorbed from contiguous and surrounding substances; but,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
if its capacity for caloric is lessened, heat will be set free and
given out to surrounding bodies.</p>
<p class='box'>The objection? 559. In what do all the physiologists of the present day
concur? How is it proved that respiration and animal heat are closely connected?
560. What is said of the apparent heat of bodies? How is this
illustrated? 561. What is the effect when the density and the arrangement
of the atoms of a body are changed?</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. Ice and salt, (Chl. of Sodium,) when
mixed, are converted into a fluid. In this state they will hold
more heat than when solid. The heat necessary to produce
this change is drawn from the surrounding medium, which is
made proportionally colder by the loss of caloric imparted to
the ice and salt. It is by this chemical process that &ldquo;ice-cream&rdquo;
is made.</p>
<p>2d. On the other hand, mix water and sulphuric acid, (oil
of vitriol,) of the temperature of 60&deg;, and the mixture will
become quite warm, and will freely impart its heat to surrounding
and contiguous objects.</p>
<p>562. The same principle is exhibited, when oxygen
unites with an inflammable body, as in the burning of wood,
coal, oil, &amp;c. In combustion, the oxygen of the atmosphere
unites with carbon and hydrogen, and carbonic acid and
water are produced. This process, according to all the known
laws of caloric, is attended with heat. The quantity of heat
disengaged in combustion is always in proportion to the
amount of carbon and hydrogen consumed; thus a piece of
wood weighing one pound, in burning slowly, would give out
the same quantity of heat as a pound of shavings of the
same wood, in burning rapidly. Upon these principles, the
production of animal heat may be understood.</p>
<p>563. The food contains carbon and hydrogen. These
exist in the chyle. The old and waste atoms of the body
likewise contain the same elements. In the lungs the oxygen
and nitrogen of the inspired air are separated. It is now
supposed that the oxygen enters the capillary vessels of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
lungs, and mingles with the blood, with which it is carried to
the heart and thence to the nutrient capillary vessels of every
part of the system.</p>
<p class='box'>Give the 1st illustration. The 2d. 562. What changes take place when
oxygen unites with an inflammable body? To what is the quantity of heat
proportionate in combustion? Give an example. 563. How are carbon
and hydrogen supplied to the system? How the oxygen? Where does
the oxygen mingle with the blood?</p>
<p>564. In the capillary vessels, the oxygen of the arterial
blood unites with the carbon and hydrogen which the refuse
materials contain, and carbonic acid and water are formed.
The combustion of carbon and hydrogen in the capillaries of
every part of the system, (the lungs not excepted,) is attended
with a disengagement of heat, and the carbonic acid and
water are returned to the lungs in the dark-colored blood,
and evolved from the system.</p>
<p>565. Sir Benjamin Brodie and some others have maintained,
that the heat of the system is generated exclusively
by the influence of the brain and nerves. This theory is discarded
by most physiologists; yet it is true that the nervous
system exercises a great influence over the action of the
capillary vessels in the process of nutrition, secretion, and
absorption. When these operations are most active, the
change among the particles of matter of which the body is
composed, is then greatest, and the generation of heat is
increased in a corresponding degree.</p>
<p>566. The necessity of pure, red blood in the production of
animal heat, is shown when the vessels that carry blood to a
limb are ligated, or tied; the part immediately becomes
colder. The necessity of nervous influence is seen in the
diminished temperature of a paralytic limb.</p>
<p>567. Our next inquiry is, By what means is the uniformity
of temperature in the body maintained? As there is a constant
generation of heat in the system, there would be an
undue accumulation,&mdash;so much so as to cause disagreeable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
sensations,&mdash;if there were no means by which it could be
evolved from the body, or its production lessened.</p>
<p class='box'>564. Where does it unite with the carbon and hydrogen contained in the
body, and how is heat generated? 565. What was the theory of Sir Benjamin
Brodie? Is this theory in general discarded? What is true of this
theory? 566. How is the necessity of pure, red blood and nervous action
shown in the production of animal heat?</p>
<p>568. It has been ascertained that the principal means by
which the system is kept at a uniform temperature, is the
immense evaporation from the skin and lungs. These membranes,
in an ordinary state, are constantly giving out water,
which is converted into vapor, and carried off by the surrounding
air. The quantity of heat abstracted from the system to
effect this, depends on the rapidity of the change of air, its
temperature, and the amount of water it contains in a state
of vapor. The quantity removed is greatest when the air
is warm and dry, and the change, or current, rapid.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The first discovery of the use of free
evaporation of the perspiration from the skin in reducing the
heat of the body, and the analogy subsisting between this
process and that of the evaporation of water from a rough
porous surface, so constantly resorted to in warm countries,
as an efficacious means of reducing the temperature of the air
in rooms, and of wine and other drinks, much below that of
the surrounding atmosphere, was made by Franklin.</p>
<p>2d. In all ages and climes, it has been observed that the increased
temperature of the skin and system in fevers, is abated
as soon as free perspiration is restored. In damp, close weather,
as during the sultry days of August, although the temperature
is lower, we feel a disagreeable sensation of heat, because
the saturation of the air with moisture lessens evaporation, and
thus prevents the escape of heat through the lungs and skin.</p>
<p>3d. It is on the principle of the evaporation of fluids that
warm vinegar and water, applied to the burning, aching head,
cools it, and imparts to it a comfortable feeling. The same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
results follow if warm liquids are applied to the skin in the
hot stage of fever; and this evaporation can be increased by
constant fanning.</p>
<p class='box'>568. What are the principal means by which a uniform temperature of the
body is maintained? On what does the quantity of heat abstracted from
the system depend? What discovery relative to animal heat is due to
Franklin? What is said of free perspiration in fevers? What occasions
the disagreeable sensation of heat in damp, close weather?</p>
<p>4th. It is frequently noticed, in very warm weather, that
dogs and other domestic animals are seen with their tongues
out of their mouths, and covered with frothy secretions. This
is merely another mode of reducing animal heat, as the
skin of such animals does not perspire as much as that of
man.</p>
<p>569. Under some circumstances, a portion of the heat of
the system is removed by radiation. When cold air comes in
contact with the skin and mucous membrane of the lungs,
heat is removed from the body, as from a stove, to restore an
equilibrium of temperature. The removal of heat from the
body is greatest when we are in a current of cold air, or
when a brisk, cold wind is blowing upon us.</p>
<p>570. As the primary object of the different processes of
nutrition is to supply animal heat, so the action of the different
nutritive organs is modified by the demands of the
system for heat. When heat is rapidly removed from the
body, the functional activity of the organs of nutrition is
increased. When the system is warmed by foreign influence,
the activity of the nutritive organs is diminished. This leads
to the natural, and, we may add, instinctive change in the
quality and quantity of food at different seasons of the year.</p>
<p class='box'>569. When is heat radiated from the body? When is it greatest?
570. What is the primary object of the different processes of nutrition?
When is the activity of the nutritive organs increased? When diminished?
To what does this lead?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF ANIMAL HEAT.</h3>
</div>
<p>571. <span class='smcap'>The</span> amount of heat generated in man and inferior
animals depends upon the quantity and quality of the food,
age, exercise, the amount and character of the respired air,
condition of the brain, skin, and general system.</p>
<p>572. <i>Animal heat is modified by the proportion of digestible
carbon which the food contains, and by the quantity consumed.</i>
As the kind of fuel that contains the greatest amount
of combustible material evolves the most caloric when burned,
so those articles of food that contain the greatest quantity of
carbon produce the most heat when converted into blood.
The inhabitants of the frigid zones, and individuals in
temperate climates during the cold season, consume with
impunity stimulating animal food, that contains a large
proportion of carbon, while the inhabitants of the tropical
regions, and persons in temperate climates during the warm
season, are more healthy with a less stimulating or vegetable
diet.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When we ride or labor in cold weather, an
adequate amount of nutritious food will sustain the warmth of
the system better than intoxicating drinks.</p>
<p>573. <i>Age is another influence that modifies the generation
of animal heat.</i> The vital forces of the child being feeble,
less heat is generated in its system than in that of an adult.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
The experiments of Dr. Milne Edwards show that the power
of producing heat in warm-blooded animals, is at its minimum
at birth, and increases successively to adult age; and that
young children part with their heat more readily than adults,
and, instead of being warmer, are generally a degree or two
colder. After adult age, as the vital powers decline, the
generation of heat is diminished, as the energies of the system
are lessened. Hence the young child, and the debilitated
aged person, need more clothing than the vigorous
individual of middle age.</p>
<p class='box'>571&ndash;585. <i>Give the hygiene of animal heat.</i> 571. State some of the influences
that modify the generation of animal heat. 572. What element of
the food influences the generation of heat? When and where can animal
food be eaten with impunity? Give the practical observation.</p>
<p>574. <i>Exercise is an influence that modifies the generation
of animal heat.</i> As carbon and hydrogen enter into the composition
of the organs of the body, whatever increases the
flow of blood in the system, increases also the deposition of
new material, and the removal of the waste particles. This
change among the particles of matter is attended with an
elevation of temperature, from the union of oxygen with the
carbon and hydrogen of the waste atoms. For this reason, a
person in action is warmer than in a quiescent state. Consequently,
the amount of clothing should be increased, when
exercise or labor is diminished or suspended.</p>
<p>575. On the other hand, whatever impedes the circulation
and the interchange of the atoms of matter, diminishes
animal heat. Common observation shows, that the extremities
are not as warm when tight gloves or boots are worn as
when they are loose. One reason is, the circulation of blood
is impeded, which is attended with less frequent change of the
particles of matter.</p>
<p>576. <i>The quantity of air which is inhaled modifies the heat
of the system.</i> In the generation of heat in a stove, air,
or oxygen, is as essential as the wood or coal. It is equally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
so in the production of animal heat. The oxygen of the
inspired air should be in proportion to the carbon and hydrogen
to be consumed. This requires voluminous lungs,
together with free movements of the ribs and diaphragm.
A person whose chest is small, and whose apparel is worn
tight over the ribs, suffers more from the cold, and complains
more frequently of chilliness and cold extremities, than the
broad-chested and loosely dressed.</p>
<p class='box'>What do the experiments of Dr. Milne Edwards show? 574. Why
does exercise influence animal heat? 575. What is the effect when the
circulation of blood is impeded? Give examples. 576. Why do those
persons that have broad chests and voluminous lungs suffer less from
cold than the narrow-chested with small <a name='TC_96'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Changed '.' to '?'">lungs?</ins></p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Fishes that breathe by means of gills, as the
cod, pike, &amp;c., depend solely on the small quantity of oxygen
that is contained in the air mixed with the water. Their
temperature is not much greater than the medium in which
they live. Whales, dolphins, &amp;c., breathe by means of lungs,
and the inhalation of atmospheric air makes their temperature
about 100&deg;, independent of the heat of the element in which
they live.</p>
<p>577. <i>The quality of respired air influences the generation
of animal heat.</i> In vestries, and other public rooms, when
crowded with an audience, where the ventilation is inadequate,
the lamps will emit but a faint light, because the oxygen is
soon expended, and there is not enough of the vivifying principle
to unite with the oil and disengage light. In the human
body, when the respired air has lost some of its life-giving
properties, the combustion that takes place in different parts
of the system is not so complete as when it contains a proper
proportion of oxygen; and hence less heat is disengaged.
For this reason, those persons that breathe impure air, either
in the daytime or night, require more clothing, than those
that work and sleep in well-ventilated rooms.</p>
<p>578. <i>The condition of the brain and nervous system affects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
the generation of animal heat.</i> If the brain is diseased, or
the mind is absorbed in thought, depressed by sorrow, or
aroused from fear, the breathing becomes slow and scarcely
perceptible, and a chilliness pervades the body, particularly
the extremities; while, on the contrary, if the mind and nervous
system are excited by joyous and agreeable emotions,
the circulation of blood is quicker, and the system more powerfully
resists external cold. During sleep, when the brain
is partially inactive, less heat is generated than when awake.</p>
<p class='box'>What is said of those fishes that breathe by means of gills? Of those
that breathe by means of lungs? 577. Why do lamps give but a faint
light in crowded, unventilated rooms? What effect on animal heat has
impure air? 578. Mention the effects of some of the mental emotions on
animal heat.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The preceding remark explains why an individual
who sleeps in the same clothing that was adequate to
prevent chills while awake, contracts a cold, unless he throws
over him an additional covering.</p>
<p>579. <i>The state of the skin exercises much influence in the
generation of heat.</i> If the functions of this membrane are
not interrupted, more heat will be generated than when it is
pallid and inactive. The action of the capillaries is most
energetic when the skin is clean; on this account, before
taking a walk or a ride, in cold weather, remove all impurities
from the skin, by thorough ablution and vigorous friction.</p>
<p>580. <i>The amount and kind of clothing modify the temperature
of the system.</i> Those persons that are well clothed
have greater power to resist cold than the thinly apparelled,
because both the evaporation and the radiation from the skin
are impeded, and less heat, in consequence, is abstracted from
the body. If the articles of apparel possess the property of
retaining air in their meshes, as flannel, the removal of heat
is not as rapid as when linen is worn.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In winter, although more heat is generated in
the system than in summer, yet we require more clothing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
and also those articles that are poor conductors of heat, because
caloric is more rapidly extracted in clear, cold weather, than
in a warm day.</p>
<p class='box'>What does the preceding remark explain? 579. What suggestion
respecting the condition of the skin before taking a walk or ride in a cold
day? Why? 580. Do the amount and kind of clothing affect animal
heat? What is said of well-clothed persons? When does the system
generate the most heat?</p>
<p>581. <i>The health and constitution influence the generation
of heat.</i> When the health is firm, and the constitution vigorous,
less clothing is needed, for the change among the particles
of matter is more rapid, and more heat is generated,
than when the opposite condition obtains. Persons of a feeble
constitution, particularly, if any of the vital organs<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> are
diseased, need more clothing and require rooms of a warmer
temperature, than individuals who are free from disease and
have a vigorous constitution.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Persons who are infirm, and whose vital
powers are feeble, in general, accustom themselves to an
undue amount of clothing and warm rooms. A more judicious
practice would be, to exercise more and use a moderate
amount of clothing, together with a more nutritious diet.</p>
<p>582. <i>The surplus heat should be removed equally from all
parts of the system.</i> The rapid evaporation of fluids, as in
free perspiration, or from radiation, as in a cold atmosphere,
is attended with a removal of heat from the system. This
modifies the action of the circulatory vessels. Consequently,
if heat is suddenly and rapidly abstracted from one part of
the system, the equilibrium of the circulation is destroyed,
which will produce disease.</p>
<p class='box'>Why do we, then, require more clothing in winter than in summer?
581. Why do persons of firm health and vigorous constitutions need less
clothing than those who are feeble? What is a general practice among
infirm persons? What would be more judicious? 582. Why should the
surplus heat be removed equally from all parts of the system? What is
said respecting currents of air from small apertures?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Currents of air that impinge upon small
portions of the body, as from small apertures, or from a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
window slightly raised, should be avoided. They are more
dangerous than to expose the whole person to a brisk wind,
because the current of air removes the heat from the part
exposed, which disturbs the circulation of blood and causes
disease, usually in the form of &ldquo;colds.&rdquo; For the same
reason, it is not judicious to stand in an open door, or the
opening of a street.</p>
<p>583. <i>The system suffers less when the change of temperature
is gradual.</i> The change in the production of heat, as
well as in the evaporation of fluids from the system, is gradual
when not influenced by foreign causes. This gradual change
is known under the name <i>acclimation</i>. By this means the
body is enabled to endure tropical heat and polar cold.
Owing to this gradual adaptation of the system to different
temperatures, we can bear a greater degree of heat in the
summer between the tropics, than in the winter under the
polar circles. On the other hand, we can endure a greater
degree of cold in winter and in the arctic region, than in
the summer and in equatorial countries.</p>
<p>584. The sensation of heat which would be oppressive in
a mild, warm day of January, would only be grateful in July,
and a degree of cold which could scarcely be endured in
August, would not be uncomfortable in December. The
changes of season in our latitude prevent the disagreeable and
perhaps fatal consequence that would follow, if no spring or
autumn intervened between the severity of winter&rsquo;s cold and
the intensity of summer&rsquo;s heat. During the transition periods,
the constitution is gradually changed, and adapted to bear the
extremes of temperature without suffering. The amount of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
heat generated in the nutrient capillary vessels, is likewise
diminished or increased as the temperature of the season
becomes greater or less.</p>
<p class='box'>583. In what manner should change of temperature take place, to be
adapted to the body? How is the body enabled to endure tropical heat
and polar cold? State some of the effects of the gradual adaptation of the
system to different temperatures. 584. What is said relative to a warm day
in winter? To a cold day in summer? What is said of the changes of
seasons in our latitude? What effect on the constitution during spring
and autumn? What change in the amount of heat generated?</p>
<p>585. But, on the contrary, we cannot suddenly pass from
one extreme of temperature to the other with impunity. Let
an inhabitant of Quebec suddenly arrive in Cuba in February,
and he would suffer from languor and exhaustion; after becoming
acclimated to this tropical climate, let him suddenly
return to Quebec in January, and the severity of the weather
would be almost insupportable.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Experience shows that heated rooms, as
well as tropical climates, lessen the generation of heat in the
body, and likewise the power of resisting cold. It would be
idle for the merchant from his warehouse, or the mechanic
from his heated shop, to attempt to sit on the box with a
coachman, with the same amount of clothing as his companion,
who is daily exposed to the inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>2d. &ldquo;It is the power of endurance of cold at one period,
and the absence of its necessity at another, that enables animals,
in their wild and unprotected state, to bear the vicissitudes
of the seasons with so little preparation in clothing, and
so little real inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>585. What effect on the system has a sudden transition from a cold to a
warm climate? What does experience show? Why do wild animals bear
the vicissitudes of the seasons with so little preparation in clothing?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE.</h3>
</div>
<p>586. <span class='smcap'>The</span> beautiful mechanism of the vocal instrument,
which produces every variety of sound, from a harsh, unmelodious
tone, to a soft, sweet, flute-like sound, has, as yet, been
imperfectly imitated by art. It has been compared, by many
physiologists, to a wind, reed, and stringed instrument. This
inimitable, yet simple instrument, is the <i>Lar&acute;ynx</i>.</p>
<p>587. Incidentally, the different parts of the respiratory
organs, as well as the larynx, are subservient to speaking and
singing. The tongue, nasal passages, muscles of the fauces
and face, are agents which aid in the intonation of the voice.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE VOCAL ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>588. The <span class='smcaplc'>LARYNX</span> is a kind of cartilaginous tube, which,
taken as a whole, has the general form of a hollow, reversed
cone, with its base upward toward the tongue, in the shape of
an expanded triangle. It opens into the pharynx, at its
superior extremity, and communicates, by its inferior opening
with the trachea. It is formed by the union of five cartilages,
namely, the <i>Thy&acute;roid</i>, the <i>Cri&acute;coid</i>, the two <i>A-ryt-e&acute;noid</i>, and
the <i>Ep-i-glot&acute;tis</i>. These are bound together by ligaments,
and moved by muscles.</p>
<p class='box'>586. What is said of the structure of the vocal instrument? With what
instrument have physiologists compared it? What is the vocal instrument
called? 587. What organs are called into action in speaking beside the
larynx? 588&ndash;596. <i>Give the anatomy of the vocal organs.</i> 588. Describe
the larynx. Name the cartilages that form the larynx.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>589. The <span class='smcaplc'>THYROID CARTILAGE</span> is the largest of the five,
and forms the prominence in the front of the neck, called
<i>Po&acute;mum A-da&acute;mi</i>, (Adam&rsquo;s apple.) It is composed of two
parts, and is connected with the bone of the tongue above,
and with the cricoid cartilage below.</p>
<p>590. The <span class='smcaplc'>CRICOID CARTILAGE</span> takes its name from its resemblance
to a ring. It is situated below the thyroid cartilage,
it is narrow in front, broader at the sides, and still broader
behind, where it is connected with the thyroid <a name='TC_97'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">cartilage.</ins>
Below, it connects with the first ring of the trachea.</p>

bodies placed upon the back part of the cricoid cartilage.
They are connected with the thyroid cartilages, by four
ligaments, called <i>Vo&acute;cal Cords</i>.</p>
<p>592. The <span class='smcaplc'>EPIGLOTTIS</span> is fibro-cartilaginous, and is placed
behind the base of the tongue. In shape it resembles a leaf
of parsley.</p>
<p>593. The <span class='smcaplc'>VOCAL CORDS</span>, or ligaments, are formed of elastic
and parallel fibres, enclosed in a fold of mucous membrane.
They are about two lines in width, and pass from the anterior
angle of the thyroid cartilage, to the two arytenoid cartilages.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
The one is called the superior, and the other the inferior vocal
ligament. The cavity, or depression between the superior

The aperture, or opening between these ligaments, is called
the <a name='TC_98'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'glot tis'"><i>glot&acute;tis</i></ins>, or <i>chink of the glottis</i>. It is about three fourths
of an inch in length, and one fourth of an inch in width, the

enlarged and contracted by the agency of the muscles appropriated
to the larynx.</p>

<p>594. The larynx is connected by muscles with the sternum,
&oelig;sophagus, base of the skull, hyoid bone, lower jaw, and
tongue. This organ is supplied with a large number of blood-vessels,
and it likewise receives nerves from the sympathetic
system, and two large nerves from the tenth pair. The number
and size of the nervous filaments distributed to the
mucous membrane of the larynx, render it more sensitive
than any other portion of the respiratory organs.</p>
<p class='box'>How is the glottis enlarged or contracted? Explain fig.&nbsp;106. 594. By
what means and to what organs is the larynx connected? Why is the
larynx more sensitive than other parts of the respiratory organs?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>595. The larynx is much more developed and prominent
in man than in woman. In the former, the anterior angle of
the thyroid cartilage is acute, while in the latter it is rounded,
and the central slope of the superior border of the same cartilage
is less deep, and the epiglottis smaller and less prominent,
than in man.</p>
<p>596. The difference in the formation of the larynx in
infancy is less striking; but at a later period, it is more
developed in the male than in the female. It is very remarkable
that this increase is not progressive, like that of other
organs, but, on the contrary, develops itself at once at the
period of puberty.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE VOCAL ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>597. In the formation of the voice, each part already
described performs an important office. The cricoid and
thyroid cartilages give form and stability to the larynx; the
arytenoid cartilages, by their movement, vary the width of the
glottis. The epiglottis is flexible and elastic. When it is
erect, the chink of the glottis is open, as in inspiration; when
depressed, as in swallowing food and drink, it covers and
closes this aperture. It prevents the introduction of articles
of food into the trachea, and probably modifies sound as it
issues from the glottis.</p>
<p>598. The muscles of the neck elevate and depress the
larynx; the muscles of the larynx increase or diminish the
width of the glottis; at the same time, the vocal cords are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
relaxed or tightened, while the muscles of the face open and
close the mouth.</p>
<p class='box'>595. What difference between the formation of the larynx of the female
and that of the male? 596. Does this difference exist in childhood? Is
its development progressive? 597&ndash;600. <i>Give the physiology of the vocal
organs.</i> 597. Which cartilages give stability and form to the larynx?
Which vary the width of the glottis? What is the function of the epiglottis?
598. What effect have the muscles of the neck upon the larynx?
The use of the muscles of the larynx?</p>
<p>599. The elasticity of the ribs and the contraction of the
abdominal muscles diminish the cavity of the chest, and the
air, in consequence, is pressed from the air-cells into the
bronchial tubes and trachea. It then rushes by the vocal
cords, and causes a peculiar vibration, which produces <i>sound</i>.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Experiments have satisfactorily shown
that the vocal cords are the principal agents in the formation of
the voice. The tongue, which many have supposed to be the
most important organ in speaking, is not essential to sound.
In several instances it has been removed, and the persons
thus mutilated could speak with fluency.</p>
<p>2d. When the vocal cords are ulcerated, or inflamed, however
slightly, as in sore throat produced by a cold, the voice
will be changed. The loss of speech among public speakers
is generally produced by a relaxation of the vocal ligaments.
Hence, bronchitis is a misnomer for this affection.</p>
<p>600. Sound is varied by the velocity of the expelled current
of air, and the tension of the vocal ligaments. The size
of the larynx, the volume and health of the lungs, the condition
of the fauces and nasal passages, the elevation and
depression of the chin, the development and freedom of
action of the muscles which are attached to the larynx, the
opening of the mouth, the state of the mind, and general
health of the system, influence the modulations of sound.</p>
<p class='box'>What effect has the combined action of these muscles? 599. How is
sound produced? What have experiments shown? What effect has disease
of the vocal ligaments upon the voice? 600. How is sound varied?
Mention other conditions that contribute to the modulation of sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE VOCAL ORGANS.</h3>
</div>
<p>601. <i>The voice can be changed and modified by habit.</i>
Sailors, smiths, and others, who are engaged in noisy occupations,
exert their vocal organs more strongly than those of
more quiet pursuits. This not only affects the structure of
the vocal organs, but varies the intonation of the voice.</p>
<p>602. <i>The voice is strong in proportion to the development
of the larynx, and the capacity of the chest.</i> Singing and
reading aloud improve and strengthen the vocal organs, and
give a healthy expansion to the chest. The enunciation of
the elementary sounds of the English language, aids in developing
the vocal organs, as well as preventing disease of the
throat and lungs. This exercise also conduces to the acquisition
of musical sounds.</p>
<p>603. <i>The attitude affects the modulation of the voice.</i>
When an individual stands erect, the movements of the whole
respiratory apparatus are most free and effective. The
larynx is brought forward by the erect position of the head
and the elevation of the chin. The muscles of the arytenoid
cartilages are then brought to a proper relation for action, by
which a tension of the vocal cords is produced, that favors
clear and harmonious enunciation.</p>
<p><i>Experiment.</i> Read with the head bowed forward and the
chin depressed; then read with the head erect and the chin
elevated, and the difference in the movement of the vocal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
organs, together with the difference in the voice, will be
manifest.</p>
<p class='box'>601&ndash;616. <i>Give the hygiene of the vocal organs.</i> 602. How may the voice
be strengthened? 603. What effect has the erect attitude upon the modulations
of the voice? Give the experiment.</p>

<p>604. If an individual or class read or sing when sitting,
let the position represented by fig.&nbsp;109 be adopted, and not
the one represented by fig.&nbsp;110; for the erect position in
sitting conduces to the free and effective action of the respiratory

<p>605. <i>The muscles of the neck should not be compressed.</i> If
the muscles of the neck and larynx are compressed by a high
cravat, or other close dressing, not only will the free and
energetic movements of these parts be impeded, but the tones
will be feeble and ineffective. Therefore the dress of the
neck, particularly of public speakers and singers, should be
loose and thin. For a warm dress upon the neck, when the
vocal organs are in action, will induce too great a flow of blood
to these parts, which will be attended by subsequent <a name='TC_99'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">debility.</ins></p>

<p>606. <i>The condition of the air modifies speaking and singing.</i>
As pure air is more elastic and resonant than impure,
and as easy, melodious speaking or singing requires atmospheric
elasticity, so school-rooms and singing-halls should be
well ventilated, if we would be entertained with soft intonations
in reading, or sonorous singing.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The imperfect ventilation of churches and
vestries is another cause of laryngitis among clergymen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
This affection is almost unknown among those who speak in
very open rooms, where stoves are not used.</p>
<p class='box'>Give 2d. observation. 606. Why does easy and melodious speaking
require pure air? What is another cause laryngitis among clergymen?</p>
<p>607. <i>The condition of the nasal passages and throat
modifies the voice.</i> The enunciation of words is rendered
more or less distinct, in proportion as the jaws are separated
in speaking, and the fauces and nasal passages are free from
obstruction. For these reasons, the scholar should be taught
to open the mouth adequately when reading, speaking, or
singing, that the sounds formed in the larynx and modified in
the fauces may have an unobstructed egress.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. If the fauces are obstructed by enlarged
tonsils, (a condition by no means uncommon in children,)
they should be removed by a surgical operation, which is not
only effective, but safe, and attended with little suffering.
The tonsils are situated on each side of the base of the
tongue, and, when enlarged, they obstruct the passage through
which the air passes to and from the lungs, and the respiration
is not only laborious, but distressing.</p>
<p>2d. When the nasal passages are obstructed, there is a
peculiar sound of the voice, which is called &ldquo;talking through
the nose.&rdquo; This phenomenon arises, not from the expired
air passing through the nose, but from its not being able to
pass through the nasal passages.</p>
<p>608. <i>The state of the mind and health exerts an influence
upon the vocal organs.</i> &ldquo;The organs of the voice, in common
with all other parts of the bodily frame, require the vigor and
pliancy of muscle, and the elasticity and animation of mind,
which result from good health, in order to perform their
appropriate functions with energy and effect. But these indispensable
conditions to the exercise of vocal organs, are, in
the case of most learners, very imperfectly supplied.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>607. Does the condition of the throat and nasal passages modify the voice?
Name the influences that produce clear enunciation of words. What is the
effect when the nasal passages are obstructed? 608. How are the vocal
organs influenced? What do they require?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>609. &ldquo;A sedentary mode of life, the want of invigorating
exercise, close and long-continued application of mind, and,
perhaps, an impaired state of health, or a feeble constitution,
prevent, in many instances, the free and forcible use of those
muscles on which voice is dependent. Hence arises the
necessity of students of elocution practising physical exercises
adapted to promote general muscular vigor, as a means of
attaining energy in speaking; the power of any class of
muscles being dependent on the vigor of the whole system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>610. &ldquo;Gymnastic and calisthenic exercises are invaluable
aids to the culture and development of the voice, and should
be sedulously practised when opportunity renders them accessible.
But even a slight degree of physical exercise, in any
form adapted to the expansion of the chest and to the freedom
and force of the circulation, will serve to impart energy and
glow to the muscular apparatus of voice, and clearness to its
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>611. &ldquo;There is, therefore, a great advantage in always
practising some preliminary muscular actions, as an immediate
preparation for vocal exercises. The art of cultivating
the voice, however, has, in addition to the various forms of
corporeal exercise, practised for the general purpose of promoting
health, its own specific prescription for securing the
vigor of the vocal organs, and modes of exercise adapted to
the training of each class of organs separately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>612. The results of such practice are of indefinite extent.
They are limited only by the energy and perseverance of the
student, excepting perhaps in some instances of imperfect
organization. A few weeks of diligent cultivation are usually
sufficient to produce such an effect on the vocal organs, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
persons who commence practice with a feeble and ineffective
utterance, attain, in that short period, the full command of
clear, forcible, and varied tone.</p>
<p class='box'>609. Why are students of elocution in general necessitated to practise
physical exercise? 610. What are invaluable aids in the culture of the
voice? 611. What is said of the art of cultivating the voice? 612. Are
the results of such practices limited? What exception?</p>
<p>613. <i>Repetition is essential to distinct articulation of
words.</i> In teaching a child to articulate a letter or word, in
the first instance, make an effort to induce a proper state of
the vocal organs by which the particular sound is produced.
Repeat the letter or word again and again, until all the parts
of the vocal apparatus harmonize in their movements to produce
the given sound. This repetition is as necessary in
learning to read as in singing.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. There is nothing gained by trying to
teach a child to pronounce the letters of the alphabet, before
the vocal organs are so developed that distinct utterance can
be given to the proper sounds.</p>
<p>2d. The drawling method of talking to young children, as
well as using words that are not found in any written language,
(called child&rsquo;s talk,) is decidedly wrong. A child will pronounce
and understand the application of a correct word as
quickly as an incorrect one.</p>
<p>614. <i>No part of the vocal organs is wanting, with those
individuals that stammer, or who have an impediment in their
speech.</i> Some parts may be more developed than others, but
they generally are but imperfectly under the control of the
will, and assume an irregular and rapid movement, while other
parts, the motions of which are essential, remain comparatively
inactive. This can be seen by comparing the movements
of the lips, tongue, and larynx, while attempting to
speak, in a person who stammers, with the movements of the
corresponding parts, while speaking, in an individual who has
no such impediment.</p>
<p class='box'>613. Is repetition essential to distinct articulation? What method is
suggested in teaching a child to articulate letters or words? Give observation
1st. Observation 2d. 614. Are the vocal organs wanting in
stammerers? Why the defect in their articulation of words?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>615. Surgical operations and medical treatment are not
highly advantageous in a majority of these cases. In the
young and middle aged, this defect can be remedied by <i>patient</i>
and judicious training. At first, only those letters and words
should be spoken that can be articulated with distinctness.
Let there be repetition, until the words can be spoken at any
time with readiness. Then take for a lesson other words,
more difficult to articulate; and pursue a similar process of
training and repetition, until every part of the vocal organs
can be called into a ready and harmonious action in giving
utterance to any word in common use.</p>
<p>616. <i>The method of removing foreign bodies from the
throat.</i> It is not necessary to ascertain which passage the
foreign body is in, for the immediate treatment ought in either
case to be the same. Some person should place one hand on
the front of the chest of the sufferer, and, with the other, give
two or three smart blows upon the back, allowing a few
seconds to intervene between them. This treatment will generally
be successful, and cause the substance to be violently
thrown from the throat.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If the foreign body passes into the larynx
violent spasmodic coughing immediately succeeds, which continues
until it is removed or life is extinct. Such cases demand
the prompt opening of the trachea below the larynx by
a skilful surgeon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>THE SKIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>617. <span class='smcap'>The</span> skin is a membrane which envelops the muscles
and other parts of the system. In youth, and in females particularly,
it is smooth, soft, and elastic. In middle age, and
in males, it is firm and rough to the touch. In old age, in
persons who are emaciated, and about the flexions of the joints,
it is thrown into folds. The interior of the body, like the
exterior, is covered by a skin, which, from the constantly
moistened state of its surface, is called the mucous membrane.
At the various orifices of the body, the exterior skin
is continuous with the internal.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE SKIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>618. The <span class='smcaplc'>SKIN</span>, to the naked eye, appears composed of one
membrane. But examination has shown that it consists of
two layers of membrane, namely, the <i>Cu&acute;ti-cle</i>, (scarf-skin,)
and the <i>Cu&acute;tis Ve&acute;ra</i>, (true skin.) These layers are widely
different from each other in structure, and perform very different
offices in the animal economy.</p>
<p>619. The <span class='smcaplc'>CUTICLE</span> (sometimes called the <i>ep-i-derm&acute;is</i>) is
the external layer of the skin. This membrane is thin and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
semi-transparent, and resembles a thin shaving of soft, clear
horn, and bears the same relation to other parts of the skin
that the rough bark of a tree does to the liber, or living bark.
The cuticle has no perceptible nerves or blood-vessels; consequently,
if it is cut or abraded, no pain will be felt, and no
fluid will ooze from it.</p>
<p class='box'>617. What is the skin? Mention its different appearances in its different
conditions in the human frame. Is the interior of the body, as well
as the exterior, covered by a skin? What is the interior membrane called?
Why has it received this name? 618&ndash;636. <i>Give the anatomy of the skin.</i>
618. What is said of the skin? What is said relative to these layers
of membrane? 619. Describe the cuticle. What name is sometimes
applied to the cuticle?</p>
<p><i>Experiment.</i> Pass a pin through the portion of the cuticle
that skirts the nails, or remove a thin shaving from the
palm of the hand, and no painful sensation will be experienced
unless the pin or knife penetrates deeper than the
cuticle.</p>
<p>620. This membrane varies in thickness on different parts
of the body,&mdash;from the thin, delicate skin upon the internal
flexions of the joints, to the thickened covering of the soles
of the feet. The greater thickness of the cuticle of the
palms of the hands and soles of the feet, is manifestly the
intentional work of the Creator; for it is perceptible in
infants, even at birth, before exercise can have had any influence.</p>
<p>621. The <span class='smcaplc'>CUTIS VERA</span> (sometimes called the <i>co&acute;ri-on</i>) is
composed of minute fibres, which are collected into small
bundles or strands. These are interwoven with each other
so as to constitute a firm, strong, and flexible web. In the
superficial part of the true skin, the web is so close as to have
the appearance of felt-cloth; but more deeply, the pores
become progressively larger, and, upon the lower surface,
have a diameter of about a line, or one twelfth of an inch.
This gives the under surface the appearance of a coarse web.
The strands of the under surface of the true skin are connected
with the fibrous web, in which the sub-cutaneous fat
of the body is deposited; while the upper surface gives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
support to the sensitive, or papillary layer, which is bedded
upon it.</p>
<p class='box'>Give the experiment. 620. What is said of the thickness of the cuticle
in different parts of the body? 621. Describe the cutis vera. By what
name is it sometimes called? What is the appearance of the upper surface
of the cutis vera? Of the under surface?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the skins of animals are immersed in
a strong solution of oak or hemlock bark, a chemical union
takes place between the gelatin, of which the true skin is
mostly composed, and the tannin of the bark. By this process
leather is formed, and its peculiar markings are owing to the
papillary layer.</p>

<p>622. The sensitive layer of the skin is thin, soft, uneven,
pinkish in hue, and composed of blood-vessels, which confer
its various tints of red; and of nerves, which give it the faculty
of sensation. The unevenness of this layer is produced
by small, elongated, conical prominences, called <i>Pa-pil&acute;l&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>623. Each <span class='smcaplc'>PAPILLA</span> is composed of a minute artery, vein,
and nerve. Some of the prominences are arranged in concentric
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
ovals, as may be seen on the ends of the fingers; others
are more or less parallel, and pursue a serpentine course;
some suddenly diverge, and again reunite, as may be seen in
the palm of the hand. Papill&aelig; are found in every part of the
skin. Consequently, their number is very great.</p>

</div>
<p>625. The <span class='smcaplc'>ARTERIES</span> AND <span class='smcaplc'>VEINS</span> of the skin are very numerous.
The larger branches of the arteries pass through the
open meshes of the true skin, and are subdivided into a
myriad of minute capillary vessels, which form a beautiful
net-work on the upper surface of the true skin. This vascular
net sends a branch to each of the papill&aelig;, which opens
into and terminates in a minute vein. The capillary veins are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
as numerous as the arteries which they accompany. They
unite and form larger trunks, as small springs from the hill
side coalesce to form rivulets.</p>
<p class='box'>624. What vessels are found in the cutis vera? Explain fig.&nbsp;112.
625. What is said of the cutaneous arteries? Of the cutaneous veins?</p>
<p>626. The <span class='smcaplc'>NERVES</span> that are spread over every part of the
sensitive layer of the true skin, proceed from the spinal cord.
As a proof of the great number of nervous filaments in the
skin, no part of this tissue can be punctured with a fine
needle without transfixing a nerve, and inducing pain. In
some parts of the system, however, the nerves are more
abundant than in others; where the sense of feeling is most
acute, we find the greatest number of nerves, and those of the
largest size. Those parts that are most exposed to injury are
most sensitive.</p>
<p><i>Examples.</i> 1st. The conjunctiva, or skin of the eye, is
pained by the presence of a particle of dust, because it
would render vision imperfect.</p>
<p>2d. The lungs, also, would be injured by the smallest particle
of matter; they are therefore protected by the exquisite
sensitiveness of the lining membrane of the trachea, so that
a particle of food or dust is ejected by a convulsive cough
before it reaches the lungs.</p>
<p>627. The nerves are more numerous in the upper than
lower extremities; in greater numbers upon the palm than
the back of the hand. They are, likewise, more abundant
and larger at the extremities of the fingers, and in the lips,
than in any other part of the skin.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The proboscis of the elephant, the extremities
of the tails of certain species of monkeys, and the tentacula
of some kinds of fish, receive a more abundant supply of sensitive
nerves than other parts of their systems.</p>
<p class='box'>626. Where do the nerves of the skin proceed from? Are they numerous
in this membrane? How is it proved? What is said of those parts
most exposed to injury? Give example 1st. Example 2d. 627. Mention
the difference in the distribution of the nerves in various parts of the
body. Is this difference found in the lower order of animals?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>628. In the small papill&aelig;, the nerve forms a single loop,
while in papill&aelig; of larger size, and endowed with a power
of more exalted sensation, the nerve is bent several times
upon itself previous to completing the loop. These little
loops spring from a net-work of nerves, imbedded in the
upper porous layer of the true skin, at the base of the papill&aelig;.
This net-work of nerves receives its influence through
nerves which take their winding course through the fat distended
openings of the deeper layers of the true skin.</p>

<p>629. The <span class='smcaplc'>LYMPHATICS</span> are found in great numbers in the
true skin, and they are so minute that they cannot be seen with
the naked eye; but when these hair-like vessels are injected
with quicksilver, (a work of great difficulty,) the surface injected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
resembles a sheet of silver. In this way their existence can
be imperfectly demonstrated. They are a part of the vascular
net-work situated upon the upper surface of the true skin.
Each papilla is supplied with a lymphatic filament, the mouth
of which opens beneath, and lies in contact with the under
surface of the cuticle. This net-work of vessels communicates
through the open meshes of the true skin with larger
lymphatic trunks, that open into the venous system.</p>

<p>630. The <span class='smcaplc'>OIL-GLANDS</span> are small bodies imbedded in the
true skin. They connect with the surface of the skin by small
tubes, which traverse the cuticle. In some parts, these glands
are wanting; in others, where their office is most needful,
they are abundant, as on the face and nose, the head, the
ears, &amp;c. In some parts, these tubes are spiral; in others,
straight. These glands offer every shade of complexity, from
the simple, straight tube, to a tube divided into numberless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
ramifications, and constituting a little rounded tree-like mass,
about the size of a millet seed.</p>
<p class='box'>Of what are they a part? 630. Describe the oil-glands. With what do
they connect? Do they exist in every part of the body? Of what form
are their tubes?</p>
<p>631. In a few situations, these small glands are worthy of
particular notice, as in the eyelids, where they possess great
elegance of distribution and form, and open by minute pores
along the lids; in the ear-passages, where they produce that
amber-colored substance, known as the <i>ce-ru&acute;men</i>, (wax of the
ears,) and in the scalp, where they resemble small clusters of
grapes, and open in pairs into the sheath of the hair, supplying
it with a pomatum of Nature&rsquo;s own preparing. The oil-tubes
are sometimes called the <i>se-ba&acute;ceous fol&acute;li-cles</i>.</p>

scalp? What are these glands sometimes called?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Among the inhabitants of cities, and especially
in persons who have a torpid state of the skin, the contents
of the oil-tubes become too dense and dry to escape in
the usual manner. Thus it collects, distends the tube, and
remains until removed by art. When this impacted matter
reaches the surface, dust and smoke mix with it, then it is
recognized by small, round, dark spots. These are seen on
the forehead, nose, and other parts of the face. When this
matter is pressed out, the tube gives it a cylindrical form.
The parts around the distended tubes sometimes inflame. This
constitutes the disease called, <i>&ldquo;ac&acute;ne punc-ta&acute;ta.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>632. The <span class='smcaplc'>PERSPIRATORY APPARATUS</span> consists of minute
cylindrical tubes, which pass inward through the cuticle, and
terminate in the deeper meshes of the cutis vera. In their
course, each little tube forms a beautiful spiral coil; and, on
arriving at its destination, coils upon itself in such a way
as to constitute an oval-shaped, or globular ball, called the
<i>perspiratory gland</i>.</p>
<p>633. The opening of the perspiratory tube on the surface
of the cuticle, namely, &ldquo;the pores,&rdquo; is also deserving of attention.
In consequence of its extremity being a section of a
spirally-twisted tube, the aperture is oblique in direction, and
possesses all the advantages of a valvular opening, preventing
the ingress of foreign injurious substances to the interior of the
tube and gland.</p>
<p>634. &ldquo;To arrive at something like an estimate of the value
of the perspiratory system, in relation to the rest of the organism,
I counted the perspiratory pores on the palm of the hand,
and found 3528 in a square inch. Now each of these pores
being the aperture of a little tube about a quarter of an inch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
long, it follows, that in a square inch of skin on the palm
of the hand there exists a length of tube equal to 882 inches,
or 73&frac12; feet. Surely such an amount of drainage as seventy-three
feet in every square inch of skin&mdash;assuming this to be
the average for the whole body&mdash;is something wonderful
and the thought naturally intrudes itself, What if this <i>drainage</i>
be obstructed?</p>
<p class='box'>What is said of the retention of the unctuous matter in the oil-tubes?
632. Of what does the perspiratory apparatus consist? 633. What is
peculiar in the opening of the perspiratory tubes on the surface of the cuticle?

the necessity of attention to the skin? On the pulps of the

skin are somewhat finer than in the palm of the hand, the
number of pores on a square inch a little exceeded that of the
palm; and on the heels, where the ridges are coarser, the
number of pores on the square inch was 2268, and the
length of the tube 567 inches, 47&frac14; feet.</p>
<p>636. &ldquo;To obtain an estimate of the length of tube of the

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SKIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>637. <span class='smcap'>The</span> skin invests the whole of the external surface of
the body, following all its prominences and curves, and gives
protection to all the organs it encloses, while each of its several
parts has a distinct use.</p>
<p>638. The cuticle is insensible, and serves as a sheath of
protection to the highly sensitive skin (<i>cutis vera</i>) situated
beneath it. The latter feels; but the former blunts the impression
which occasions feeling. In some situations, the
cuticle is so dense and thick, as wholly to exclude ordinary
impressions. Of this we see an example in the ends of the
fingers, where the hard and dense nail is the cuticle modified
for the purpose referred to. Were the nervous tissue of the
true skin not thus protected, every sensation would be so acute
as to be unpleasant, and contact with external bodies would
cause pain.</p>
<p>639. The cuticle, also, prevents disease, by impeding the
evaporation of the fluids of the true skin, and the absorption of
the poisonous vapors, which necessarily attend various employments.
It, however, affords protection to the system only
when unbroken, and then, to the greatest degree, when
covered with a proper amount of oily secretion from the oil-glands.</p>
<p>640. The cuticle is, originally, a transparent fluid, exuded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
by the blood-vessels, and distributed as a thin layer on the surface
of the true skin. While successive layers are formed on
the exterior of the true skin, the external cuticular layers are
converted into dry, flattened scales, by the evaporation of their
fluid contents. The thickness of the cuticle is formed mainly
from these scales.</p>
<p class='box'>637&ndash;656. <i>Give the physiology of the skin.</i> 637. What is said of the
skin? 638. Give a function of the cuticle. Does it vary in thickness on
different parts of the body? Give examples. 630. Mention another use
of the cuticle. 640. What is the cuticle originally?</p>
<p>641. The cuticle is, therefore, undergoing a constant process
of formation and growth at its under part, to compensate
for the wear that is taking place continually on its surface. A
proper thickness of the cuticle is in this manner <a name='TC_101'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added ';'">preserved;</ins>
the faculty of sensation and that of touch are properly regulated;
the places of the little scales, which are continually
falling off under the united influence of friction and ablution,
are supplied; and an action necessary, not merely to
the health of the skin, but to that of the entire body, is
established.</p>
<p>642. Whenever the cuticle is exposed to moderate and
repeated friction, it becomes thicker and tougher, as may be
seen in the cuticle of the lady&rsquo;s finger that plies the needle
and in the hard or callous appearance of the hands of farmers
masons, and other mechanics. This enables them to handle
the utensils and materials used in their vocations without pain
or inconvenience.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. When the joints of the feet are subjected
to moderate and continued pressure or friction, frequently
one or more of the papill&aelig; enlarge. This is
accompanied with a thickening of the layers of the cuticle,
which is termed a &ldquo;callosity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;corn.&rdquo; These thickened
layers of the cuticle are broad at the top and narrow at the
bottom, and the enlarged mass is conical, with the point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
innermost. When pressed upon by a tight shoe, these sensitive
papill&aelig; cause pain.</p>
<p class='box'>How is the thickness of the cuticle mainly formed? 641. Describe the
changes of this membrane. Show the necessity of this constant growth.
642. How does moderate and repeated friction affect the cuticle? Give
examples. What is the benefit derived from having the cuticle thus
changed? What is the result if the joints of the feet are subjected to
moderate and continued pressure? What is the form of a &ldquo;corn&rdquo;?</p>
<p>2d. To remove these painful excrescences, take a thick
piece of soft leather, somewhat larger than the corn; in the
centre punch a hole of the size of the summit of the corn,
spread the leather with adhesive plaster, and apply it around
the corn. The hole in the leather may be filled with a paste
made of soda and soap, on going to bed. In the morning,
remove it, and wash with warm water. Repeat this for
several successive nights, and the corn will be removed. The
only precaution is, not to repeat the application so as to
cause pain.</p>
<p>643. Let a person unaccustomed to manual labor, trundle
the hand-cart, or row a boat, for several successive hours, and
the cuticle upon the palms of the hands, instead of becoming
thicker by use, is frequently separated from the subjacent
tissues, by an effusion of serum, (water,) thrown out by the
vessels of the true skin. Had the friction been moderate,
and applied at regular intervals, instead of blisters being
formed upon the inside of the hands, material would have
been thrown out to form new layers upon the lower surface
of the cuticle.</p>
<p>644. The cuticle is interesting to us in another point of
view, as being the seat of the color of the skin. The difference
of color between the blonde and the brunette, the European
and the African, lies in the cuticle;&mdash;in the deeper, and
softer, and newly-formed layers of that structure. In the
whitest skin, the cells of the cuticle always contain more or
less of a peculiar pigment, incorporated with the elementary
granules which enter into their composition. In the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
races, the pigmentary tint is extremely slight, and less in
winter than in the summer season. In the darker races, on
the contrary, it is deep and strongly marked.</p>
<p class='box'>How can they be removed? What precaution is given? 643. Explain
why those persons unaccustomed to labor, blister their hands in rowing a
boat or performing ordinary manual employment for several successive
hours. 644. In what other point of view is the cuticle interesting? In
what part of it do we find the coloring matter?</p>
<p>645. The various tints of color exhibited by mankind, are,
therefore, referable to the amount of coloring principle contained
within the elementary granules of the cuticle, and
their consequent depth of hue. In the negro, the granules
are more or less black; in the European of the south, they
are amber-colored; and in the inhabitants of the north, they
are pale and almost colorless.</p>
<p>646. Color of the skin has relation to energy in its action;
thus, in the equatorial region, where light and heat are most
powerful, the skin is stimulated by these agents to vigorous
action, and color is very deep; while in the temperate regions,
where light and heat are not so intense, the lungs, liver, and
kidneys relieve the skin of part of its duties. The colored
layer of the cuticle has been called the <i>re&acute;te mu-co&acute;sum</i>,
(mucous coat of the skin,) and described as a distinct layer
by many physiologists.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> &ldquo;The various coloring of the inner layer of
the cuticle gives to some animals their varied hues; the serpent,
the frog, the lizard, and some fishes have a splendor of
hue almost equal to polished metal. The gold-fish and the
dolphin owe their difference of color and the brilliancy of
their hues to the color of this layer of the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>647. The nerves of the skin are the organs of the sense
of touch and feeling. Through them we receive many impressions
that enhance our pleasures, as the grateful sensations
imparted by the cooling breeze in a warm day. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
consequence of their sensitiveness, we are individually protected,
by being admonished of the proximity of destructive
agents.</p>
<p class='box'>In what season of the year is the coloring matter less in the white race?
645. To what is the color of the skin referable? 646. Why have the races
of the torrid zone darker complexions than those of the temperate or frigid
zones? What is this colored layer called by many physiologists? To
what is the different hues in animals owing? 647. Of what use are the
nerves of the skin?</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> A man who had been afflicted some years
with a severe disease of a portion of the brain and spinal
cord, was deprived of feeling in the lower extremities. He
was directed by his attending physician to use a warm footbath.
Intending to follow the directions given him, he
immersed his feet in boiling water, which he supposed of a
proper temperature. While his feet were immersed in the
water, he experienced no sensation of an unpleasant nature.
On withdrawing them, he was astonished to find the cuticle
separated from the other tissues, by the effusion of serum,
and thus producing a blister over the whole surface.</p>
<p>648. Portions of the skin would suffer every day, were it
not for the sentinel-like care exercised by the nerves, by
which all impressions are transmitted to the brain. As the
skin is continually exposed to the influence of destructive
agents, it is important that the nerves, provided for its protection,
should be kept in a healthy state.</p>
<p>649. A large proportion of the waste of the body passes
through the outlets of the skin; some portions in the form
of oil, others in the form of water and carbonic acid.</p>
<p>650. The oil-glands secrete an oil, partly free and diffused,
and partly mixed with albumen. When the cells are fully
formed, that is, fully distended, they yield their contents,
and the fluid matter they contain is set free, and passes along
the tubes to the surface; this fluid matter constitutes the oily
element of the economy of the skin.</p>
<p>651. The uses of the unctuous product of the oil-glands
are twofold: 1st. The protection; 2d. The removal of waste
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
matter from the system. In the exercise of these offices the
oily substance is diffused over those parts of the skin which
are naturally exposed to vicissitudes of temperature and
moisture,&mdash;as the nose, face, and head;&mdash;to the injurious
attrition of contiguous surfaces,&mdash;as the flexures of joints;&mdash;or
the contact of acrid fluids,&mdash;as in the excoriations to which
infants are liable.</p>
<p class='box'>Give the illustration. 648. Why is it necessary that the cutaneous nerves
be kept in a healthy state? 649. Through what membrane does a large
proportion of the waste material of the system pass? 650. What is the
function of the oil-glands? 651. What are the uses of the oily product
of these glands?</p>
<p>652. The oil of the unctuous substance is the principal
agent in effecting these purposes: 1st. It prevents the evaporation
or congelation of the water of the cuticle, which
would cause it to become parched and peel off, thus leaving
the sensitive skin exposed. 2d. It affords a soft medium to
the contact of moving substances. 3d. It repels moisture and
fluids. 4th. The action of these glands removes the waste
atoms and purifies the blood.</p>
<p>653. In considering the purpose of the oily matter of the
skin, there are two situations in which it deserves especial
remark. 1st. Along the edges of the eyelids, where it is
poured out in considerable quantity. Here, it is the means
of confining the tears and moisture of the eyes within the
lids, defending the skin from the irritation of that fluid, and
preventing the adhesion of the lids, which is liable to occur
upon slight inflammation. 2d. In the ears, where the unctuous
wax not only preserves the membrane of the drum and the
passage of the ear moist, but also, by its bitterness, prevents
the intrusion of small insects.</p>
<p>654. The use of the perspiratory glands is to separate from
the blood that portion of the waste matter which is carried
off through the skin in the form of vapor. Sanctorius, a
celebrated medical writer, daily, for thirty years, weighed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
himself, his food, and excretions. He estimated that <i>five</i> of
every <i>eight</i> pounds of food and drink passed from the system
through the many outlets upon the skin. Many place the
estimate much lower. All physiologists agree that from
twenty to forty ounces of matter pass off from the skin of an
adult every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class='box'>652. What prevents the evaporation of the water of the cuticle? Give
its 2d use. Its 3d. Its 4th. 653. What is said in reference to the distribution
of the oily matter along the edges of the eyelids? In the ears?
654. Of what use are the perspiratory glands? How long did Sanctorius
daily weigh his food, to ascertain the amount of secretion that passed
through the skin?</p>
<p>655. The average amount of perspiration is about thirty
ounces; and it passes off in such minute portions, and mixes
so rapidly with the surrounding air, that it is not perceived.
For this reason, it is called <i>insensible</i> perspiration. When
this excretion is increased, it forms into drops, and is called
<i>sensible</i> perspiration. The following experiments prove the
existence of this excretion from the skin.</p>
<p><i>Experiments.</i> 1st. Take a cold bell-glass, or any glass
vessel large enough to admit the hand, and introduce it perfectly
dry; at the same time close the mouth by winding a
napkin about the wrist; in a short time, the insensible perspiration
from the hand, will be seen deposited on the inside
of the glass. At first, the deposit is in the form of mist; but,
if the experiment be continued a sufficient time, it will collect
in drops.</p>
<p>2d. Hold the apparently dry hand near a looking-glass, and
the invisible vapor will soon be condensed, and cover the glass
with a slight dew.</p>
<p>656. It is important that this excretion be maintained with
steadiness and regularity. When the action of the perspiratory
glands is suppressed, all the vessels of the different
organs will suffer materially, and become diseased, by the
redundant waste matter that should be carried from the system.
If a person is vigorous, the action of the organs, whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
functions are similar to those of the skin, as channels for
the exit of waste matter, will be increased, and thus relieve
the diseased state of the body. But the over-taxing of these
organs, to relieve the system, often produces a diseased action
in themselves.</p>
<p class='box'>What were his conclusions? 655. What is the average amount of perspiration
every twenty-four hours? What is insensible perspiration?
What is sensible perspiration? How can the existence of the excretion of
the skin be shown? Give the 2d experiment. 656. Why is it important
that these excretions be maintained regularly?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE SKIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>657. <span class='smcap'>The</span> sensibility of the skin, and the activity of the
oil and perspiratory glands, are modified by the condition
of the cuticle, the temperature of the skin and body, the
purity and warmth of the air, and the character of the light
to which the body is exposed. Thus, to maintain a healthy
action of every part of this membrane, attention should be
given to <i>Clothing</i>, <i>Bathing</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>Air</i>.</p>
<p>658. <span class='smcap'>Clothing</span>, in itself, does not bestow heat, but is
chiefly useful in preventing the escape of heat from the body,
and in defending it from the temperature of the atmosphere.
In selecting and applying clothing to our persons, the following
suggestions should be observed.</p>
<p>659. <i>The material for clothing should be a bad conductor
of heat</i>; that is, it should have little tendency to conduct or
remove heat from the body. This depends mainly on the
property possessed by the material in retaining atmospheric
air in its meshes.</p>
<p>660. <i>The material for clothing should not possess the
property of absorbing and retaining moisture.</i> Dampness,
or moisture, renders apparel a good conductor of heat; beside,
if the perspired fluid, and the saline material it holds in solution,
are readily absorbed by the clothing, they become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
sources of irritation to the skin with which the apparel comes
in contact.</p>
<p class='box'>657&ndash;716. Give the hygiene of the skin. 657. What influences modify
the action of the oil and perspiratory glands? To what must attention
be given to maintain a healthy action of the skin? 658. What is
said in regard to the clothing? 659. Mention a property that the material
for clothing should possess. 660. What property in the selection of clothing
should we avoid? Why?</p>
<p>661. <i>Furs</i> contain a greater amount of air in their meshes,
than any other article, and they absorb no moisture; consequently,
as an article of dress, they are best adapted to those
who are exposed to great vicissitudes of heat and cold.</p>
<p>662. <i>Woollen cloth</i> retains more air in its meshes than
any other article except furs and eider down, and it absorbs
but very little moisture. These properties, together with its
comparative cheapness, render it a good article of apparel for
all classes of persons. The only objection to its general use
is, the disturbance of the electricity of the system, and the
irritation to delicate skins from the roughness of its fibres.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Flannels are not only beneficial, during the
cold season, in preventing colds and rheumatism, but they are
of great utility in the warm season, in shielding the system
from the chills at evening, that induce disease of the alimentary
canal. Their general use among children and delicate
females, would be a preventive of the &ldquo;season complaints&rdquo;
prevalent in the months of August and September.</p>
<p>663. <i>Cotton</i> contains less air in its meshes than woollen,
but much more than linen. In texture, it is smoother than
wool, and less liable to irritate the skin. This fabric absorbs
moisture in a small degree. In all respects, it is well adapted
for garments worn next the skin. When woollen flannels
irritate the skin, they may be lined with cotton.</p>
<p>664. <i>Silk</i> is not as good a conductor of heat as cotton, nor
does it absorb moisture to any considerable degree; its texture
is smooth, and does not irritate the skin; consequently, when
the garment of this fabric has sufficient body or thickness, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
is a good article for clothing. The greatest objection to its
use is the disturbance of the electricity of the system, and
its high price.</p>
<p class='box'>661. Give the properties of fur. As an article of dress, to whom are they
best adapted? 662. Give the properties of woollen cloth. Is this a good
article for clothing? What objection? What are the advantages of
wearing flannels? 663. What are the qualities of cotton as an article of
dress? 664. Of silk?</p>
<p>665. <i>Linen</i> is not only a good conductor of heat, and
consequently a poor article of apparel, but it likewise absorbs
the fluids carried from the system by the agency of the oil
and perspiratory glands. When garments are made of this
material, the body is not surrounded by a layer of air, but by
one of moisture. This still further increases its power to
conduct heat from the system, rendering it a very objectionable
article of apparel, even in warm weather and in hot
climates, where the dress is usually thin.</p>
<p>666. <i>Clothing differs in its power of radiating heat.</i>
This is influenced by the color; those articles that radiate
heat freely also absorb it readily. A black surface is a good
radiator, while a white surface is not, because it reflects the
calorific rays. It is obvious that those colors which render
the transmission of external heat difficult, must impede the
transmission of caloric from the body. Thus it is manifest,
that light-colored apparel is best adapted for every season and
every climate.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Coach-drivers are practically aware, that in
cold weather, light-colored over-coats are warmest, except
when they are exposed to the direct rays of the sun, or when
seated before a warm fire. On the other hand, when the
temperature is elevated, light-colored apparel is coolest, because
the sun&rsquo;s rays are then reflected.</p>
<p>667. <i>The clothing should be of a porous character.</i> The
skin is not only an important agent in separating from the
blood those impurities that otherwise would oppress the system
and occasion death, but it exercises great influence upon the
system, by receiving oxygen through its tissues, and giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
back carbonic acid in return. Consequently, the apparel
should be made of a material that will permit free transpiration
from the skin, and likewise convey the excreted fluids
from the surface.</p>
<p class='box'>665. What is said of linen as an article of apparel? 666. Why is light-colored
apparel best adapted for every season? What is said of the apparel
of coach-drivers? 667. Why should we wear porous clothing?</p>
<p>668. The necessity for this is illustrated in wearing India
rubber over-shoes. If they are worn over boots ten or twelve
hours, not only the hose, but the boots will be moist from
retained perspiration, and the residual matter left in contact
with the skin may be reconveyed into the system by absorption,
causing headache and other diseases. Cotton and woollen
fabrics are not only bad conductors of heat, but are also
porous; for these reasons, they are well adapted to transmit
the excretions of the skin.</p>
<p>669. <i>The clothing should be not only porous, but fitted
loosely.</i> The garments should retain a layer of air between
them and the body. Every one is practically aware that a
loose dress is much warmer than one which fits closely; that a
loose glove is warmer than a tight one; and that a loose boot
or shoe affords greater warmth than one of smaller dimensions.
The explanation is obvious; the loose dress encloses
a thin layer of air, which the tight dress is incapable of
doing; and what is required, is, that the dress should be
closed at the upper part, to prevent the dispersion of the
warm air, by the ventilating current which would be established
from below.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> As the purpose of additional garments is to
maintain a series of strata of warm air within our clothing, we
should, in going from a warm room into the cold air, put on
our defensive coverings some little time previous, in order
that the layers of air which we carry with us may be sufficiently
warmed by the heat of the room, and not borrowed
from the body on exposure to the cold.</p>
<p class='box'>668. How is the necessity of porous clothing illustrated? 669. Why
should we wear loose garments? What is the use of additional garments
when going from a warm to a cold air? When should they be put on?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>670. <i>The clothing should be suited to the temperature of the
atmosphere and the condition of the individual.</i> The invariable
rule should be, to wear enough to maintain an equal and
healthy action of the skin. Care should be taken, however,
that the action of the cutaneous vessels is not inordinately
increased, as this would debilitate, not only the skin, but the
internal organs of the system, as the stomach and lungs.</p>
<p>671. No rule as to the quantity of clothing can be given,
as the demand will vary with different individuals. The following
are among the most prominent causes of this variation:
Those persons who have large, active brains, full chests, well
developed lungs, breathe an adequate amount of pure air, and
take sufficient food to supply the wants of the system, require
less clothing than those of an opposite character, because
more heat is generated in the system.</p>
<p>672. <i>The child and the aged person require more clothing
than the vigorous adult.</i> &ldquo;Should we judge from observation,
the inference would be, that children require less clothing
than adults. This is an error, for the temperature in infancy
is not only lower than in manhood, but the power of creating
heat is feebler. The same remarks are applicable to those
persons who have outlived the energies of adult life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The system of &ldquo;hardening&rdquo; children, by an
inadequate supply of clothing, and keeping them uncomfortably
cold throughout the whole day, is inhuman, as well as
unprofitable. It operates upon the child somewhat like the
long-continued chill upon a certain portion of the farmer&rsquo;s
herd, that are kept shivering under the thatched shed, retarding
the growth of their systems, which require more food to
satisfy the keen cravings of hunger than when they are comfortably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
sheltered. To make the boy robust and active, he
must have nutritious food at stated hours, and free exercise in
the open air, and his system must be guarded from chills by a
due amount of apparel.</p>
<p class='box'>670. What should be the invariable rule in reference to the amount of
clothing that should be worn? What precaution should be observed?
671. What are some of the causes of the variation of the demand for
clothing? 672. Why do the child and aged person require more clothing
than the vigorous adult? What is said of the system of hardening
children?</p>
<p>673. <i>More clothing is needed when a vital organ is diseased.</i>
It may be observed that in consumption, dyspepsia,
and even in headache, the skin is pale and the extremities
cold, because less heat is generated. Thus persons affected
with these complaints, when exposed to cold air, need more
clothing than those individuals whose organs are not diseased,
and the functions of which are properly performed.</p>
<p>674. <i>More clothing is required in the evening, than
during the day.</i> In the evening we have less vital energy,
and therefore less heat is generated in the system, than in the
early part of the day; beside, the atmosphere is damp, the
skin has become moist from free perspiration, and heat, in
consequence, is rapidly removed from the system. For this
reason, when returning from crowded assemblies, we should
be provided with an extra garment.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. If there is a chill upon the system after
having arrived home, warmth should be restored as speedily
as possible. This can be done by friction with warm flannels,
and by using the warm or vapor bath. By this procedure,
the pernicious effects of the chill will be prevented before any
disease is fixed upon the system. Is it not the duty of the
parent and the guardian to learn these facts, and to see that
they are not only learned, but reduced to practice?</p>
<p>2d. The farmer and industrious mechanic would be freed
from many a rheumatic pain, if, while resting from their
labors at evening, or taking the ordinary meal after hard toil,
they would put on an extra garment. The coat might not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
feel so agreeable for the first few minutes, but it would
ultimately conduce to health and longevity.</p>
<p class='box'>673. Why do dyspeptic and consumptive persons require more clothing
than those who have healthy vital organs? 674. Why do we need more
clothing in the evening than during the day? How can the pernicious
effects of a chill be prevented? Give the 2d observation.</p>
<p>675. <i>The person of active habits requires less clothing than
one of sedentary employments.</i> Exercise increases the circulation
of the blood, which is always attended by the disengagement
of a greater quantity of heat; consequently, an
increase of warmth is felt throughout the system. We likewise
need more clothing while riding, than when we are
walking; because the exercise of the former is less than that
of the latter. The same is true when resting in the field or
shop, after laborious exercise.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> We need a greater amount of clothing while
asleep, than during the day; as not only the action of the
body, but that of the brain, during sleep, is suspended.</p>
<p>676. <i>Less clothing is required when the cutaneous surface
is clean.</i> A film of impurities obstructs the perspiratory
ducts, and diminishes the action of their glands; consequently,
less heat is generated. For this reason, the hands
or feet when clean are less liable to become chilled or frozen.</p>
<p>677. <i>The sensitiveness of the skin to the influence of cold,
is much modified by habit.</i> A person who has been habituated
to the temperature of a warm room, or warm climate, suffers
more when exposed to cold, than an individual who has been
accustomed to colder air. Thus a person who labors or
studies in a warm room, should wear more clothing when
exposed to the air, while walking or riding, than an individual
who labors in a cooler atmosphere. Not only is the sensibility
of the skin increased by a warm atmosphere, but the
activity of the digestive, respiratory, and nervous systems, in
generating heat, is much diminished. This is an additional
reason why an increased amount of clothing is demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
during exposure to cold air. In all cases where practicable
the heat of the system should be maintained by exercise, in
preference to the use of fur or flannel.</p>
<p class='box'>675. Why does the person of active habits require less clothing than one
of sedentary employments? 676. Why do we need less clothing when
the skin is clean? 677. Show the effect of habit on the sensitiveness of
the skin.</p>
<p>678. <i>Those parts of the skin usually covered, uniformly
need that protection.</i> The power of generating heat is
diminished, and the impressibility to cold is increased, on those
portions of the skin usually clothed. If a person wears the
dress high and close about the neck, he suffers from exposure
to a cold atmosphere if a dress is worn that is not as high or
more open. As a general rule, it is preferable that those
parts of the system, as the larynx, be exposed that are not
uniformly protected by clothing.</p>
<p>679. <i>The clothing should be kept clean.</i> No article of
apparel is entirely free from absorption; even wool and cotton
possess it in a small degree. They take up a portion of the
transpired fluids which contain saline and animal matter, and
thus the fibres of the garments become covered with the
cutaneous excretions. We are practically aware of the retention
of these secretions from the soiled appearance of those
garments worn next the skin, which are so covered as to preclude
the particles of dust from lodging upon them.</p>
<p>680. The porosity of the clothing is lessened when soiled,
and its power of conducting heat from the system in consequence,
is increased. The residual matter with which the
clothing is coated is brought in contact with the skin, which
causes irritation, and not unfrequently re-absorption of the
elements, thrown off from the system through this avenue.
Hence warmth, cleanliness, and health require that the
clothing, particularly the garments worn next to the skin,
should be frequently and thoroughly washed. This should
not be forgotten in regard to children, for their blood circulates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
with greater rapidity than that of adults, and a proportionably
greater amount of waste matter is thrown off from
their systems.</p>
<p>681. <i>The under-garments worn during the day should not
be worn at night, or the reverse.</i> When under-garments are
worn several successive days or nights, they should not be put
in drawers, or hung up in a close closet, as soon as taken from
the body, but should be exposed to a current of air.</p>
<p>682. <i>Occupied beds should be thoroughly aired in the
morning.</i> The excretions from the skin are most abundant
during the hours of sleep; and if the sheets and blankets,
together with the bed, are not aired every morning, by being
so arranged that both surfaces may be exposed to the air, the
materials eliminated from the skin will be retained in the
meshes of the bed-clothing, and may be conveyed into the
system of the next occupant, by absorption. Oftentimes
diseases of a disagreeable nature are contracted in this way.
This fact should be instilled into every mother&rsquo;s and daughter&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Bed-linen should not be put on a bed when
it is not sufficiently dried, or contains moisture from the excretions
of the skin, nor should beds or bedding be slept in, that
have remained in a damp room that has not been occupied for
many weeks, unless the dampness is removed from the bed-linen
by a warming-pan, or in some other way.</p>
<p>683. <i>Changes of dress, from thick to thin, should always
be made in the morning.</i> At this time the vital powers are
usually in full play. Many a young lady has laid the foundation
of a fatal disease, by disregarding this rule, in exchanging
the thick dress, with woollen stockings, for the flimsy
dress and hose of silk or cotton, which are considered suitable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
for the ball-room or party. Sudden changes in wearing-apparel,
as well as in food and general habits, are attended
with hazard; and this is proportionate to the weakness or
exhaustion of the system when the change is made.</p>
<p class='box'>681. Should the garments worn during the day be worn at night?
682. What is said respecting the cleanliness of beds and bedding?
Why should not bed-linen that is damp be slept in? 683. When should
change of dress from thick to thin be made? Why?</p>
<p>684. <i>When the clothing has become wet, it is best to change
it immediately.</i> The skin should then be rubbed with a dry
crash towel, until reaction, indicated by redness, is produced.
If the garments are not changed, the person should exercise
moderately, so that sufficient heat may continue to be generated
in the system to dry the clothing and skin without a chill.
Sitting in a cool shade, or current of air, should, by all means,
be avoided; as colds are not contracted by free and excessive
exercise, but by injudicious management after such exercise.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When an individual has been thrown into a
profuse perspiration by violent exercise, though the skin and
clothing may become wet, he feels no inconvenience from the
dampness, as long as he continues that amount of exercise
for the reason that the circulation of the blood being increased
heat is generated in sufficient quantity to replace the amount
abstracted from the system in evaporating the free perspiration;
but as soon as the exercise is discontinued, the increased
circulation subsides, and with it the extra amount of generated
heat. This accounts for the chill we experience, when
the damp clothing is permitted to dry on the body, after the
cessation of exercise.</p>
<p class='box'>684. What suggestion when the clothing has become wet? What should
be done if the garments are not changed? What causes the chill that is
experienced when damp clothing is permitted to dry on the body?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE SKIN, CONTINUED.</h3>
</div>
<p>685. <span class='smcap'>Bathing</span>, its necessity and expediency, is obvious
from the structure and the functions of the skin. The cuticle
is cast off in minute, powdery scales, many of which are
retained upon the surface by the pressure of clothing. These
mingle with the oily and saline products of the skin, and form
a thin crust. This crust, on account of its adhesiveness,
collects particles of dust and soot from the atmosphere, and
particles of foreign matter from our dress; so that in the
course of the day the whole body becomes coated with impurities.
If this coating remains, becomes thick and established
upon the skin, it will produce the following effects:&mdash;</p>
<p>686. 1st. <i>The pores will be obstructed, consequently transpiration
impeded, and the influence of the skin as an excretory
entirely prevented.</i> When the pores are obstructed, and
transpiration is checked, the elements of the transpired fluids
will necessarily be retained in the system; and, as they are
injurious and poisonous if retained, they must be removed by
those organs whose functions in the animal economy are similar,
as the lungs, kidneys, liver, intestines, &amp;c.</p>
<p>687. When these organs are called upon to perform their
offices, and in addition that of another, the healthy equilibrium
is destroyed, and the oppressed organ will suffer from exhaustion,
and become the prey of disease. Thus, obviously, habits
of uncleanliness are a cause of consumption and other serious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
diseases of the vital organs. Again, obstruction of the
pores will prevent respiration through the skin, thus depriving
the blood of one source of its oxygen, and one outlet of its
carbonic acid, which will diminish the temperature of the
system, and the same results follow as when the clothing is
inadequate.</p>
<p class='box'>685. Show the necessity for bathing. 686. What effect upon the body
if the pores of the skin are obstructed? 687. What is the effect when an
organ not only performs its own specific function, but that of another?</p>
<p>688. 2d. <i>The retained perspirable matter will irritate the
skin, both mechanically and chemically</i>; and this membrane
will be kept damp and cold, from attraction and detention of
moisture; and foreign material, as before adverted to, once
removed from the system, may be reconveyed into it by absorption.
As a consequence, cutaneous eruptions and diseases
will be produced, and the re-absorption of matter once separated
from the system, will be the exciting cause of other
injurious disorders.</p>
<p>689. 3d. <i>A film of foreign substance on the skin will
inevitably become the seat of detention of miasmata and
infectious vapors.</i> These will remain until absorbed, and
engender the diseases of which they are the peculiar cause.
This is one reason why filthy persons contract infectious
diseases more frequently than individuals of cleanly habits.</p>
<p>690. <i>Bathing is useful to promote cleanliness.</i> In this
capacity, it enables us to remove the coating of impurities
from the exterior of our persons. It effects this purpose by
dissolving saline matters, and holding in temporary suspension
those substances which are insoluble.</p>
<p>691. The cuticle is composed of a substance resembling
the dried white of egg, or, in a word, <i>albumen</i>. This is soluble
in alkalies, and these are the agents which are commonly
employed for purifying the skin. Soap is a compound of the
alkali soda with oil, the former being in excess. When used
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
for washing, the excess of alkali combining with the oily fluid,
with which the skin is naturally bedewed, removes it, in the
form of an emulsion, and with it a portion of any adhering
matter. Another portion of the alkali softens and dissolves
the superficial layer of the cuticle; and when this is removed
the cuticle is free from impurities.</p>
<p class='box'>688. How are cutaneous eruptions frequently produced? 689. How
are infectious vapors transmitted to the system? 690. How does bathing
promote cleanliness? 691. Why is it necessary to use soap in
bathing?</p>
<p>692. Every washing of the skin with soap removes the
old face of the cuticle, and leaves a new one; and were
the process repeated to excess, the latter would become so
thin as to render the body sensible to impressions too slight
to be felt through its ordinary thickness. On the other hand,
when the cuticle and its accumulated impurities are rarely
disturbed, the sensitiveness of the skin is impaired. The
proper inference to be drawn from the preceding remarks, is
in favor of the <i>moderate</i> use of soap to cleanse the skin.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If any unpleasant sensations are felt after the
use of soap, they may be immediately removed by washing the
surface with water slightly acidulated with lemon juice or
vinegar, which neutralizes the alkali that may remain on
the skin. This is effective treatment for &ldquo;chapped hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>693. <i>Bathing may be partial or general, and the water
used may be cold, temperate, tepid, warm, or hot.</i> A person
may apply it to his system with a sponge, it may be poured
upon him, or he may immerse himself in it. The simplest
mode of bathing is to apply water to a small extent of surface,
by means of a wet sponge, and after being wiped dry,
again cover with the dress. In this way the whole body may
be speedily subjected to the influence of water, and to no less
useful friction. The water used may be warm or cold. This
species of bathing may be practised by any invalid, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
always with benefit, if the bathing is succeeded by a glow of
warmth over the surface; and this is the test by which the
benefit of all forms of bathing is to be estimated.</p>
<p class='box'>692. Why should only a moderate amount of soap be used in bathing?
If unpleasant sensations are felt from too free use of soap, how can they
be counteracted? 693. Give the different forms of bathing. What is the
simplest mode of bathing? Can this mode be adopted by invalids with
safety?</p>
<p>694. When the heat of the system is adequate, the bather
may stand or sit in a shallow tub, while he receives the water
from a sponge squeezed over the shoulders or against the
body. In this form of bathing, the person is more exposed to
the cold air, and on this account it is less suitable for very
feeble individuals than the first-mentioned method. In the
early use of this form of the sponge-bath, the bather should
content himself with a single affusion from the sponge; the
body should be quickly wiped with a soft towel, and friction
applied with a crash towel or a brush.</p>
<p>695. The third kind of bathing is that of the shower-bath,
which provides a greater amount of affusion than the former,
combined with a greater shock to the nervous system. The
concussion of the skin by the fall of water, particularly distinguishes
this from the previous modes of bathing. The
degree of concussion is modified by the size of the openings
through which the water issues, and the height of the reservoir.
The shower-bath admits of modification, adapting it to
the most delicate as well as the robust. The extent of fall,
the size of the apertures, the quantity and temperature of the
water, may be regulated at pleasure.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In using the shower-bath, it would be judicious
to commence with warm or tepid water, for which, by a
gradual process, cold water may be substituted. In this way
the system may be inured to cold water. After bathing, the
skin should be wiped dry and rubbed briskly.</p>
<p>696. The fourth form of bathing is that in which the body,
or a portion of it, is immersed in water. The temperature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
of water in this form of bathing may be modified according
to the sensations and purposes of the bather. This form
of bathing is designated according to the heat of the water.
When the temperature is below 75&deg;, it is termed a cold bath;
when from 75&deg; to 85&deg;, a temperate bath; from 85&deg; to 95&deg;, a
tepid bath; from 95&deg; to 98&deg;, a warm bath; from 98&deg; to 105&deg;,
a hot bath. In using this form of bathing, the skin should
be wiped perfectly dry, and briskly rubbed.</p>
<p class='box'>What is the test by which to estimate, the benefit of all modes of bathing?
694. Give another method of sponge-bathing. 695. What is said
of the shower-bath? What caution is given? 696. Give the fourth form
of bathing.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The length of time a person may remain in
a cold bath with benefit varies from two to ten minutes;
while a person may remain in a temperate, tepid, or warm
bath, from ten to thirty minutes, or until special indications
are exhibited.</p>
<p>697. In the vapor-bath, the vapor is not only applied to the
exterior of the system, but it is inhaled and brought in contact
with every part of the interior of the lungs. The bather
is seated upon a chair, and the vapor gradually turned on
around him, until the proper temperature (90&deg; to 110&deg;) is
attained. The bath may be continued from ten to thirty
minutes. After leaving the bath, attention should be given to
the skin, as in other forms of bathing.</p>
<p>698. In order to increase and promote reaction of the skin,
various measures and processes are used, some of which
are practised in, and others after, quitting the bath. Of the
former, the rubbing and brushing the skin are the most common
and important. The brisk and efficient friction of the
skin with a coarse towel and flesh-brush, after quitting the
bath, should never be omitted. This short catalogue embraces
all the appliances requisite for the purpose.</p>
<p>699. <i>Bathing promotes health by its immediate and remote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
physiological effects on the system.</i> When the body is moistened
with a sponge wet with cold water, or when an affusion
by the sponge or shower-bath is used, the skin instantly
shrinks, and the whole of its tissue contracts. This contraction
diminishes the capacity of the cutaneous system of
blood-vessels, and a portion of the blood circulating through
them is suddenly thrown upon the more internal parts of the
body. The nervous system, among others, participates in it,
and is stimulated by the afflux, and communicates its stimulus
to the whole system. This causes a more energetic action of
the heart and blood-vessels, and a consequent rush of blood
back to the skin. This is the state termed <i>reaction</i>, the first
object and purpose of every form of bathing.</p>
<p class='box'>What degree of temperature of water is termed a cold bath? A temperate?
A tepid? A warm? A hot bath? State the length of time
that a person should remain in the different baths. 697. What is said of
the vapor bath? 698. Mention the different methods for promoting reaction
of the skin.</p>
<p>700. This condition of the skin is known by the redness
of the surface, the glow, comfort, and warmth which follow
the bath. The bather should direct all his care to insure
this effect. By it the internal organs are relieved, respiration
is lightened, the heart is made to beat calm and free, the mind
is clear and strong, the tone of the muscular system is increased,
the appetite is sharpened, and the whole system feels
invigorated. This is the end and aim of the bather, and to
this all his training tends. The error is, to expect the result
without the preparation.</p>
<p>701. In order to promote reaction, and to be efficient in
preserving health, bathing should be regular, should be commenced
by degrees, and increased by a process of training,
and should not be permitted to intrude upon hours devoted to
some important function, as digestion. It must not precede
or follow too closely a meal, or severe mental or muscular
exercise, as reaction is less certain and vigorous when important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
internal organs are employed, than when they are at
rest. When the vital powers are greatest, and the system
most free from exhaustion, bathing is most beneficial; hence
the morning is preferable to the evening, and the middle of
the forenoon to the middle of the afternoon, for this healthful
and agreeable duty; as the vital action of the system is most
energetic in the early part of the day.</p>
<p class='box'>699. What is the effect upon the skin when cold water is applied?
What is the first object and purpose of every form of bathing? 700. How
is this condition of the skin known? Mention the salutary effects that this
condition has on the body. 701. How should bathing be performed, in
order to be efficient in preserving health?</p>
<p>702. In regard to the frequency of bathing, the face and
neck, from their necessary exposure to the atmosphere, and
the impurities which the latter contains, should receive at
least two washings in twenty-four hours, one of which should
be with soap; the feet, from the confined nature of the coverings
which are worn over them, require at least one; the
armpits, from the detention, as well as from the peculiar
properties of the secretions, at least one; and the hands and
arms, as many as seem proper. The whole person should be
bathed at least every second day, but the most perfect health
of every part of the body would be maintained, if the excretions
from the skin were removed daily.</p>
<p>703. In diseases of the skin and internal organs, bathing
is a remedial measure of great power. It should never be
neglected or omitted. It is not only pleasant and safe, but is
really more effective than any medicine administered internally.
This, like other curative means, should be applied by
the direction and under the eye of the medical adviser, that
it may be adapted to the condition of the patient.</p>
<p>704. &ldquo;From the first hour of man&rsquo;s existence to his latest
breath, in health and in sickness, rich or poor, water is always
requisite. Baths were dedicated by the ancients to the divinities
of medicine, strength, and wisdom, namely, &AElig;sculapius,
Hercules, and Minerva, to whom might properly be added the
goddess of health, Hygeia. The use of water has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
enforced as a religious observance, and water has been adopted
as one of the symbols of Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>When should bathing be performed? 702. How often should we bathe?
703. What is said of bathing in disease? Who should direct the kind of
bath proper in different diseases? 704. Were baths dedicated by the
ancients?</p>
<p>705. The <span class='smcaplc'>AIR</span> is an agent of importance in the functions of
the skin. It imparts to this membrane oxygen, and receives
from it carbonic acid. It likewise removes from it a large
portion of the perspiration and the more fluid portions of the
oily secretion. In order that the air may accomplish these
ends, it is necessary that it come in contact with the body.
This is one of the many reasons why we should wear loose
and porous clothing.</p>
<p>706. Again, the air should be pure, and free from redundant
moisture. In the warm mornings of July and August,
the air is loaded with moisture and impurities, and the perspirable
matter is not removed from the system as it is when the
air is pure and dry. This is the cause of the general lassitude
that is experienced during such mornings. As soon as the
fog is dispelled, these unpleasant sensations are removed. To
sustain the functions of the skin in a healthy state, the parlor,
kitchen, sleeping-room, school-house, and work-shop, should
be well ventilated. The blood of the system will be purer,
and its color of a brighter scarlet, if the skin is surrounded
by fresh and pure air, than when it is foul or moist.</p>
<p>707. The <span class='smcaplc'>LIGHT</span> permeating the skin, not only exercises a
salutary influence upon this membrane, but upon the blood,
and, through this fluid, upon the whole system. For this
reason, the kitchen and the sitting-room, which are the apartments
most used by ladies, should be selected from the most
pleasant and well-lighted rooms in the house. On the other
hand, dark rooms and damp cellar-kitchens should be avoided,
as exercising an injurious influence upon both body and mind.</p>
<p>708. The dark, damp rooms, so much used in cities and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
large villages, by indigent families and domestics, are fruitful
causes of disease, as well as of vice, poverty, and suffering.
Common observation shows that solar light also exercises much
influence upon the vigor and color of vegetables. Plants
that are kept in well-lighted rooms, have darker and more
brilliant colors than those that grow in darkened apartments.</p>
<p class='box'>705. Give the reasons why pure air should be supplied to the skin.
706. What is the cause of the general lassitude in a damp, warm morning?
707. Show the salutary effects of light on the skin. 708. What is
one cause of disease and suffering in large villages?</p>
<p>709. <span class='smcap'>Burns</span> and <span class='smcaplc'>SCALDS</span> are terms applied to those conditions
of the skin which are produced by the application of
an undue amount of heat, which changes the action of its
vessels.</p>
<p>710. A small degree of heat will irritate the nerves, and
cause an increased action of the blood-vessels. This is
attended with severe smarting pain, and will be followed by
the deposition of serum under the cuticle, unless applications
are made immediately, to prevent vesication, or blistering.
To prevent or suppress this state of arterial action, wet some
folds of cotton or woollen cloth with cold water, and apply
them to the parts scalded; continue to apply cold water, so as
to steadily maintain the low temperature of the applications,
as long as the <i>smarting pain</i> is experienced. The steady
application of cold dressing also tends to prevent an increased
action of the blood-vessels, and will suppress it, if it already
exist.</p>
<p>711. When blisters are formed, the cuticle is separated
from the other tissues of the skin by the effusion of serum.
In all cases, if this layer of the skin is not removed, a small
opening should be made in the raised cuticle, by which
the serum deposited may be removed. Under such circumstances,
never remove the cuticle, as it makes the best possible
covering for the blood-vessels and nerves of the true skin.
The cold water dressing, recommended in the preceding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
paragraph, may then be applied as long as the smarting sensation
continues. After the pain has subsided, the blistered part
may be covered by a patch of cotton or linen cloth, upon
which an ointment, made of lard and bees-wax, has been
spread.</p>
<p class='box'>709. To what condition of the skin are the terms burns and scalds applied?
710. What is the effect when only a small degree of heat is applied to the
skin? How can vesication be prevented? 711. What should be the treatment
when blisters are formed?</p>
<p>712. If the cuticle has been removed, there will be much
suffering, because the nerves are unduly stimulated by the
air. The cuticle is the sheath or covering of the vessels
and nerves of the skin, and when it is removed, a substitute
should be applied. This substitute should be soothing, and
cover the denuded surface. Linseed-meal or ground slippery-elm
bark poultice, fresh cream, or lard and bees-wax, spread
upon linen or cotton cloth, would make a good dressing.
When dressings are applied, they should not be removed until
they become dry and irritating.</p>
<p>713. If there is much suffering, administer to an adult from
twenty-five to sixty drops of laudanum, according to the
severity of the pain. If the patient is a child, from fifteen
drops to a tea-spoonful of paregoric may be administered.
When there is much prostration, some hot peppermint tea or
other stimulant may be found necessary to bring on reaction.</p>
<p>714. The hands, feet, ears, &amp;c., are subject, in cold latitudes,
to be <i>frozen</i>, or <i>frost-bitten</i>. This may occur when the
patient, at the moment, is not aware of it. The part affected
at first assumes a dull red color, which gradually gives place
to a pale, waxy appearance, and becomes quite insensible.
The first thing to be done in such cases, is to re&euml;stablish circulation.
This should be effected very gradually. If a large
quantity of blood is thrown suddenly into the chilled and
debilitated vessels of the frozen part, inflammation may be
produced that will destroy the vitality of the limb.</p>
<p class='box'>712. That should be the treatment if the cuticle has been removed?
How often should the dressing of burns be removed? 713. What may be
necessary when there is much suffering? 714. What is the appearance of
limbs while freezing? How should the circulation be at first re&euml;stablished?
What should be avoided?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>715. The circulation and sensibility may be restored by
rubbing the frozen limb, with snow, or, when this is not to be
obtained, cold water; but snow is always to be preferred.
The fire should be avoided; and it would be better for the
patient to be kept in a cold room, for a time, where there is
no fire, or where the temperature is moderate.</p>
<p>716. When a person is found benumbed with cold, and
almost or quite insensible, he should be taken into a cold room,
the clothing removed, and friction commenced and continued
for some time, with <i>snow</i>. When warmth begins to be
restored, the individual should be rubbed with dry flannel, and
the friction continued until reaction takes place.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the toes and heels have been repeatedly
chilled, there may be produced a disease called <i>chilblains</i>.
This affection is attended with tenderness of the parts,
accompanied with a peculiar and troublesome itching. The
prevention of this disease is in wearing warm hose and thick
shoes of ample size. Bathing the feet morning and evening
is also a prevention of this disagreeable affection. When
chilblains exist, apply cold water, warm camphorated spirits,
or turpentine linament.</p>
<p class='box'>715. How may the circulation and sensibility be restored? 716. What
treatment should be adopted when a person is benumbed with cold? What
treatment should be adopted when warmth begins to be restored? What
is said of chilblains?</p>

<h3>APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>717. <span class='smcap'>The</span> <span class='smcaplc'>HAIRS</span> are appendages of the skin, and, like
the cuticle, they are a product of secretion. They have no
blood-vessels or nerves, and, consequently, no vitality. The
hairs take their origin from the cellular membrane, in the
form of bulbs. Each hair is enclosed beneath the surface
by a vascular secretory follicle, which regulates its form during
growth. In texture, it is dense, and homogeneous toward
the circumference, and porous and cellular in the centre, like
the pith of a plant. Every hair has on its surface pointed
barbs, arranged in a spiral manner, and directed toward the
root of the hair; so that, if a hair be rolled between the fingers,
it moves only in one direction.</p>

The hair follicle (1) is represented as imbedded in the cellular membrane, (2,) which is situated beneath the skin. 3, 3, The membranous sac, which has a narrow neck, opening externally by a contracted orifice, through which the hair (4) passes. Its internal surface is smooth, and not adherent to the hair, but separated from it by a reddish fluid. From the bottom of the sac (5) the pulp of the hair arises, and passes through the skin at 6.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p class='box'>717&ndash;723. <i>Describe the appendages of the skin.</i> 717. Why have not hairs
vitality? Where do they take their origin? Give their structure. What
is represented by fig.&nbsp;118?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>718. The color of the hair varies in different individuals,
and is generally supposed to depend on the fluids contained
in the pith. There are two causes which act in changing
the hair gray. The first is, defective secretion of the coloring
fluid. The second is, the canals, which convey the fluid
into the hair, become obliterated. In the first instance, the
hair will remain; in the second, it dies, and drops out; the
cuticle of the scalp grows over the canal, which is soon obliterated,
and the head becomes bald.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is related that the hair of Marie Antoinette,
Queen of France, and others, from excessive mental agitation,
changed from black to gray in a single night. This is
not strictly true; the secretion may be arrested, but that
already deposited in the pith will require days or weeks to be
removed.</p>
<p>719. Upon the upper part of the head, the oil-tubes open
into the hair-sacs; consequently, the secretion of the oil-glands
is spread over the surface of the hair, and not upon
the cuticle. This is the cause of the dry, white, branny
scales, called &ldquo;scurf,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dandruff,&rdquo; upon the head. This
is natural, and cannot be prevented. When scurf exists, the
only necessary application to remove it, is the frequent use
of the hair-brush, and washing with pure water.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The secretion of the oil-glands may become
impacted around the hairs as they issue from the skin, and
thus prevent their outward movement in growing. The
pressure of the matter deposited at their bulbs will then cause
itching. The comb and the brush may be used to remove the
impacted matter, and relieve the disagreeable sensation.</p>
<p>720. The oil is most abundant near the roots of the hair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
A free use of the brush spreads it along the hairs, and gives
them a smooth, glossy appearance. Soap should rarely be
used in washing the head, as it will remove the oil which is
essential to the health and appearance of the hair.</p>
<p class='box'>718. Upon what does the color of the hair depend? What are the causes
of the hair becoming gray? What is the cause of the hair dropping out?
What is related of Marie Antoinette? 719. How is &ldquo;dandruff&rdquo; on the
scalp produced? What is the only necessary application to remove it?
Give observation. 720. Where is the oil of the hair most abundant?</p>
<p>721. The uses of the hair vary in different regions of the
body. Upon the head, it aids in shielding the brain from
injury by blows, and it likewise serves to protect this part
of the system from heat and cold, thus maintaining equal
temperature of the cerebral organ. About the flections of the
joints, as in the axilla, (armpit,) they prevent irritation of the
skin from friction; in the passages to the ears and nostrils, they
present an obstacle to the ingress of insects and foreign bodies;
while in the eyebrows and eyelids, they serve to protect the
organ of vision.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>722. The <span class='smcaplc'>NAILS</span> are hard, elastic, flexible, semi-transparent
scales, and present the appearance of a layer of horn. The
nail is divided into the <i>root</i>, the <i>body</i>, and the <i>free portion</i>.
The root is that part which is covered on both surfaces; the
body is that portion which has one surface free; the free portion
projects beyond the end of the finger.</p>
<p>723. The nail is formed of several lamin&aelig;, or plates, that
are fitted the one to the other; the deepest is that which is
last formed. The nails, as well as the hoofs of animals and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
the cuticle, are products of secretion. They receive no blood-vessels
or nerves. If the cuticle be removed in severe scalds
they will separate with it, as the hoofs of animals are removed
by the agency of hot water. The nails increase in length
and thickness, by the deposition of albumen upon their under
surface, and at their roots, in a manner similar to the growth
of the cuticle, of which they constitute a part.</p>
<p class='box'>How can it be spread along the hairs? Why should soap not be used
in washing the hair? 721. Of what use is the hair upon the head? About
the flexions of the joints? In the nasal and ear passages? Upon the eyebrows
and eyelids? 722. Describe the nails. 723. How are they formed?</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The nail upon its under surface is fashioned
into thin vertical plates, which are received between the
folds of the sensitive skin. In this manner, the two kinds of
lamin&aelig; reciprocally embrace each other, and the firmness of
connection of the nail is maintained. If we look on the surface
of the nail, we see an indication of this structure in the
alternate red and white lines which are there observed. The
former of these correspond with the sensitive lamin&aelig;; the latter
with the horny plates. The ribbed appearance of the nail
is due to the same circumstance. These sensitive lamin&aelig; are
provided with an unusual number of capillary vessels for the
formation of the nail, and hence they give a red tint to the
portion under which they lie.</p>
<p>2d. Near the root of the nail there is a part that is not
laminated, and it is less abundantly supplied with blood-vessels.
This portion consequently looks pale compared with the laminated
portion, and from its half-moon shape is technically
termed <i>lunula</i>. Beyond the lunula, the root of the nail is
imbedded in the fold of the sensitive skin, and has the same
relation to that structure that any single one of the thin horny
plates of its under surface has to its corresponding pair of sensitive
lamin&aelig;.</p>
<p>724. The nails, from their position, are continually receiving
knocks, which produce a momentary disturbance of their
cell formation, followed by a white spot. The care of the
nails should be strictly limited to the knife or scissors, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
their free border, and an ivory presser, to prevent adhesion
of the free margin of the scarf-skin to the surface of the
nail. This edge of the cuticle should never be pared, the
surface of the nail never scraped, nor the nails cleaned with
any instrument whatever, except the nail-brush, aided by
water and soap. An observance of these suggestions, will
prevent irregularities and disorders of the nails.</p>
<p class='box'>Give observation 1st. Observation 2d. 724. How should the nails be
treated to prevent irregularities and disease?</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. When we wear a shoe that is too short
for the foot, the edge of the nail is brought against the leather.
This interrupts the forward growth of the nail, and it spreads
out on the sides, and becomes unusually thick. It then presses
upon the soft parts, and is said to &ldquo;grow into the flesh.&rdquo; The
prevention is, to wear shoes of ample size.</p>
<p>2d. Instances are by no means unfrequent in which the
power of production of the nail at the root becomes entirely
destroyed, and it then grows in thickness only. When this
affection occurs, it is often remarkable what a mass the nail
presents. Instances are on record, where the nail is regularly
shed; and, whenever the old nail falls off, a new one is found
beneath it, perfectly formed. Sometimes the growth in length
is not entirely checked, although growth in thickness is induced;
the nail then presents a peculiar appearance.</p>

the life of an animal whose organization is superior to all
others. We have noted the wonderful mechanism of the
muscular system, in producing the varied movements of the
body, the different processes by which the food is converted
into chyle and mixed with the blood, and the circulation of
this fluid to every organ and tissue of the system, that each
may select from it the very principles which it requires for
its growth.</p>
<p>726. Lymphatic absorption commences as soon as nutrition
is completed, and conveys the useless, worn-out particles
of different tissues back into the circulating fluid; while the
respiratory organs and secretory glands perform the work
of preparing the waste products to be eliminated from the
body. Each of these processes effects a single object, and is
performed in a regular manner.</p>
<p>727. &ldquo;They must succeed each other in proper order in
propelling every particle to its proper destination, or life
would be sacrificed almost at the moment of its commencement.
There is, therefore, a mutual dependence of all portions
of the machinery of organic life upon each other, and a necessity
for some medium of communication from one organ to
another, by which they may convey mutual information of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
their several conditions, if we may be permitted to employ a
figurative expression. Were there no such medium, how
would the stomach notify the heart that additional exertion on
its part is required, because the stomach is busy in digesting
food?</p>
<p class='box'>725. What has been noted in the preceding chapters? 726. Show the
manner in which the several processes are performed. 727. How must
they succeed each other?</p>
<p>728. &ldquo;When we are exerting the muscular system for a
long time in some laborious employment, how else are our
members to inform the stomach that they are too much occupied
with their duties to spare the blood necessary in digestion;
that it is requisite that the appetite should decline; and
that digestion should cease for the time, even if the stomach
should be oppressed with its contents? When we are thinking,
how else are the blood-vessels to be told that an unusual
supply of their contents is wanting in the head? or when the
whole frame is weary with exertion, how, without some regular
line of intelligence between all the organs, is the brain to be
instructed that circumstances require that it should go to
sleep? To supply the necessary medium of communication,
Providence has furnished all the animals that possess
distinct organs, with a peculiar apparatus called the <i>Nervous
System</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ANATOMY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>
</div>
<p>729. The <span class='smcaplc'>NERVOUS SYSTEM</span> consists of the <i>Cer&acute;e-bro-spi&acute;nal
Cen&acute;tre</i>, and of numerous rounded and flattened white cords,
called <i>nerves</i>, which are connected at one extremity with the
cerebro-spinal centre, and at the other, distributed to all the
textures of the body. The sympathetic nerve is an exception
to this description; for, instead of one, it has many small
centres, which are called <i>gan&acute;gli-a</i>, and which communicate
very freely with the cerebro-spinal centre, and with its
nerves.</p>
<p class='box'>728. What is the medium of communication from one organ to another?
729&ndash;754. <i>Give the anatomy of the brain and cranial nerves.</i> 729. Of what
does the nervous system consist? What constitutes an exception to this?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>730. The <span class='smcaplc'>CEREBRO-SPINAL CENTRE</span> consists of two portions:
The <i>brain</i>, and the <i>spinal cord</i>. For convenience of description,
the nervous system may be divided into the <i>Brain</i>,
<i>Cranial Nerves</i>, <i>Spinal Cord</i>, <i>Spinal Nerves</i>, and the <i>Sympathetic
Nerve</i>.</p>
<p>731. The term <span class='smcaplc'>BRAIN</span> designates those parts of the nervous
system, exclusive of the nerves themselves, which are contained
within the cranium, or skull-bones; they are the <i>Cer&acute;e-brum</i>,
<i>Cer-e-bel&acute;lum</i>, and <i>Me-dul&acute;la Ob-lon-ga&acute;ta</i>. These are
invested and protected by the membranes of the brain, which
are called the <i>Du&acute;ra Ma&acute;ter</i>, <i>A-rach&acute;noid</i>, and <i>Pi&acute;a Ma&acute;ter</i>.</p>

<p>732. The <span class='smcaplc'>CEREBRUM</span> IS divided into two hemispheres, by a
cleft, or fissure. Into this cleft dips a portion of the dura
mater, called the <i>falx cer&acute;e-bri</i>, from its resembling a sickle.
The apparent design of this membrane is to relieve the one
side from the pressure of the other, when the head is reclining
to either side. Upon the superior surface of the cerebrum
are seen undulating windings, called <i>con-vo-lu&acute;tions</i>.
Upon its inferior, or lower surface, each hemisphere admits
of a division into three lobes&mdash;the anterior, middle, and
posterior. (Fig.&nbsp;122, 123)</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>733. When the upper part of the hemispheres is removed
horizontally with a sharp knife, a centre of white substance is
brought to view. This is surrounded by a border of gray,
which follows the depressions of the convolutions, and presents
a zigzag outline. The divided surface will be seen
studded with numerous small red points, which are produced
by the escape of blood from the division of the minute arteries
and veins. The gray border is called the cortical, or <i>cineritious</i>
portion, while the white central portion is called the
<i>medullary</i>. The two hemispheres are connected by a dense
layer of transverse fibres, called <i>cor&acute;pus cal-lo&acute;sum</i>.</p>
<p>734. In the interior of the brain there are several cavities,
two of which are of considerable size, and are called the
lateral ventricles. They extend from the anterior to the posterior
part of the brain, and wind their way into other parts of
the cerebral organ.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the disease called &ldquo;dropsy of the brain,&rdquo;
(hydrocephalus internus,) the serum, or water, is usually deposited
in these ventricles. This is effused from the many
small blood-vessels of the membrane in these cavities.</p>
<p>735. The brain is of a pulpy character, quite soft in
infancy and childhood; but it gradually becomes more and
more consistent, and in middle age it assumes the form of
determinate structure and arrangement. It is more abundantly
supplied with blood than any organ of the system.
No lymphatics have been detected, but it is to be presumed
that they exist in this organ.</p>
<p>736. The <span class='smcaplc'>CEREBELLUM</span> is about seven times smaller than
the cerebrum. Like that organ, it is composed of white and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
gray matter, but the gray constitutes the larger portion. Its
surface is formed of parallel plates separated by fissures.
The white matter is so arranged, that when cut vertically, the
appearance of the trunk and branches of a tree (<i>ar&acute;bor vi&acute;t&aelig;</i>)
is presented. It is situated under the posterior lobe of the
cerebrum, from which it is separated by a process of the dura
mater, called the <i>ten-to&acute;ri-um</i>.</p>

<p>739. The <span class='smcaplc'>ARACHNOID</span>, so called from its extreme tenuity, is
the serous membrane of the brain and spinal cord, and is, like
other serous membranes, a closed sac. It envelops these
organs, and is reflected upon the inner surface of the dura
mater, giving to that membrane its serous investment.</p>
<p>740. The <span class='smcaplc'>PIA MATER</span> is a vascular membrane, composed
of innumerable vessels, held together by cellular membrane.
It invests the whole surface of the brain, and dips into its
convolutions. The pia mater is the nutrient membrane of the
brain, and receives its blood from the carotid and vertebral
arteries. Its nerves are minute branches of the sympathetic,
which accompany the branches of the arteries.</p>
<p>741. The <span class='smcaplc'>CRANIAL NERVES</span>, that connect with the brain, are

<i>Hy&acute;po-glos&acute;sal</i>.</p>
<p>742. The <span class='smcaplc'>OLFACTORY NERVE</span> (first pair) passes from the
cavity of the skull through many small openings in a plate of
the <i>eth&acute;moid</i> bone. (This plate is called <i>crib&acute;ri-form</i>, from
its resemblance to a sieve.) This nerve ramifies upon the
membrane that lines the nasal passages. It is the softest
nerve of the body. (Fig.&nbsp;136.)</p>

<p>746. The <span class='smcaplc'>TRIFACIAL NERVE</span> (fifth pair) is analogous to the
spinal nerves in its origin by two roots, from the anterior
and posterior columns of the spinal cord. It has a ganglion,
like the spinal nerves upon its posterior root. For these
reasons, it ranges with the spinal nerves, and is considered
the cranial spinal nerve. This nerve divides into three
branches:&mdash;The <i>oph-thal&acute;mic</i>, superior <i>max&acute;il-la-ry</i>, and inferior
<i>max&acute;il-la-ry</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>755. <span class='smcap'>The</span> spinal column contains the spinal cord, the roots
of the spinal nerves, and the membranes of the cord.</p>
<p>756. The <span class='smcaplc'>SPINAL CORD</span> extends from the medulla oblongata
to the second lumbar vertebra, where it terminates in a rounded
point. It presents a difference of diameter in different
parts of its extent, and exhibits three enlargements. The
uppermost of these is the medulla oblongata. There is no
distinct demarkation between this enlargement and the spinal
cord. The next corresponds with the origin of the nerves
distributed to the upper extremities; the third enlargement
is situated near the termination of the cord, and corresponds
with the attachment of the nerves which are intended for the
supply of the lower extremities.</p>
<p>757. An anterior and posterior fissure divides the spinal
cord into two lateral cords. These are united by a thin layer
of white substance. The lateral cords are each divided by
furrows into three distinct sets of fibres, or columns; namely
the <i>anterior</i>, <i>lateral</i>, and <i>posterior</i> columns. The anterior
are the motor columns; the posterior are the columns of sensation;
the lateral columns are divided in their function between
motion and sensation. They contain the fasciculus
described, by Sir Charles Bell, as the respiratory tract.

extent of the spinal cord. How many enlargements has this cord? What
is said of each enlargement? 757. Into how many parts is the spinal
cord divided? Give the function of these columns.</p>
<p>758. The <span class='smcaplc'>SPINAL NERVES</span>, that connect with the spinal
cord, are arranged in thirty-one pairs, each arising by two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
roots; an anterior, or <i>motor</i> root, and a posterior, or <i>sensitive</i>
root. Each nerve, when minutely examined, is found to consist
of an aggregate of very delicate filaments, enclosed in a
common cellular envelope.</p>

<p>759. The anterior roots arise from a narrow white line
upon the anterior columns of the spinal cord. The posterior
roots arise from a narrow gray band formed by the internal
gray substance of the cord. They are larger, and the filaments
of origin more numerous than those of the anterior
roots. A ganglion is found upon each of the posterior roots
in the openings between the bones of the spinal column through
which the nerve passes.</p>

<p>760. After the formation of the ganglion, the two roots
unite, and constitute a spinal nerve, which passes through the

column. The nerves divide and subdivide, until their minute
filaments ramify on the tissues of the different organs.</p>

<p>762. The four lower cervical and upper dorsal pass into
each other and then separate to reunite. This is called the
<i>brach&acute;i-al plex&acute;us</i>. From this plexus six nerves proceed,
which ramify upon the muscles and skin of the upper extremities.</p>
<p>763. The last dorsal and the five lumbar nerves form a
plexus called the lumbar, similar to that of the cervical. Six
nerves pass from this plexus, which ramify upon the muscles
and skin of the lower extremities.</p>
<p>764. The last lumbar and the four upper sacral unite to
form the sacral plexus. From this plexus five nerves proceed,
that are distributed to the muscles and skin of the hip
and lower extremities.</p>

<i>Gan&acute;gli-a</i>, or knots, extending each side of the spinal column,
forming a chain its whole length. It communicates with both
the cranial and spinal nerves. With the exception of the
neck, there is a ganglion for each intervertebral space. These
ganglia are composed of a mixture of cineritious and medullary
matter, and are supposed to be productive of peculiar
nervous power.</p>

<p>766. The <span class='smcaplc'>GANGLIA</span> may be considered as distinct centres,
giving off branches in four directions; namely, the superior,
or ascending, to communicate with the ganglion above; the
inferior, or descending, to communicate with the ganglion
below; the external, to communicate with the spinal nerves;
and the internal, to communicate with the sympathetic filaments.
It is generally admitted that the nerves that pass from
the ganglia are larger than those that entered them; as if
they imparted to the nerve some additional power.</p>
<p>767. The branches of distribution accompany the arteries
which supply the different organs, and form communications
around them, which are called plexuses, and take the name
of the artery with which they are associated. Thus we have
the mesenteric plexus, hepatic plexus, splenic plexus, &amp;c. All
the internal organs of the head, neck, and trunk, are supplied
with branches from the sympathetic, and some of them exclusively;
for this reason, it is considered a nerve of organic life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>
</div>
<p>768. <span class='smcap'>The</span> brain is regarded by physiologists and philosophers
as the organ of the mind. Most writers consider it as
an aggregate of parts, each charged with specific functions,
and that these functions are the highest and most important
in the animal economy. To the large brain, or cerebral lobes,
they ascribe the seat of the faculties of <i>thinking</i>, <i>memory</i>, and
<i>the will</i>. In man, this lobe extends so far backward as to
cover the whole of the cerebellum. To the cerebellum, or
little brain, is ascribed the seat of the <i>animal</i>, or <i>lower propensities</i>.</p>
<p>769. &ldquo;The constant relation between mental power and
development of brain, explains why capacities and dispositions
are so different. In infancy, for example, the intellectual
powers are feeble and inactive. This arises partly from the
inaptitude of a still imperfect brain; but in proportion as the
latter advances toward its mature state, the mental faculties
also become vigorous and active.&rdquo;</p>
<p>770. We are able, in most instances, at least, to trace a
correspondence between the development of the cerebral lobes
and the amount of intelligence possessed by the person. The
weight of the brain in man to that of the whole body varies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
in different individuals. The heaviest brain on record was
that of Cuvier, which weighed 4 pounds and <a name='TC_109a'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was '13 1&ndash;2'">13&frac12;</ins> ounces.</p>
<p class='box'>768&ndash;772. <i>Give the physiology of the nervous system.</i> 768. How is the
brain regarded by physiologists and philosophers? What do they ascribe
to the cerebrum? To the cerebellum? 769. What does the relation between
mental powers and development of brain explain? 770. What is
said respecting the correspondence between the development of the brain
and the amount of intelligence possessed by the person? What is said of
the weight of the brain?</p>
<p>771. The brain likewise holds an important relation to all
the other organs of the system. To the muscular system it
imparts an influence which induces contraction of the fibres.
By this relation they are brought under the control of the will.
To the skin, eye, and ear, it imparts an influence that gives
sensibility, or the power of feeling, seeing, hearing, &amp;c.</p>
<p>772. Again, the involuntary functions of the different portions
of the system are more or less influenced by the brain.
If the action of this central organ of the nervous system is
destroyed, the functions of the digestive, respiratory, and circulatory
apparatuses will be much disturbed or entirely suppressed.</p>
<p>773. The brain is the seat of <i>sensation</i>. It receives the
impressions made on all parts of the body, through the medium
of the sensitive nerves. That the impressions of external
objects, made on these nerves, be communicated to the brain,
where sensation is perceived, it is necessary that they be not
diseased or injured.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> There is a plain distinction between sensations
and impressions; the latter are the changes produced
in the extremities of the nerve; the former, the changes produced
in the brain and communicated to the mind.</p>
<p>774. What part of the brain receives the impressions or has
the most intimate relation with the intellectual faculties is
unknown. Some portions, however, are of less importance
than others. Large portions of the cortical, or outer part, are
frequently removed without affecting the functions of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
organ. Pieces of the medullary, or central parts, have been
removed by injuries without impairing the intellect or destroying
life. This organ, although it takes cognizance of every
sensation, is, of itself, but slightly sensible. It may be cut, or
parts may be removed without pain, and the individual, at
the same times retain his consciousness.</p>
<p class='box'>771. What is said of the relation of the brain to all of the organs of the
body? 772. Are the involuntary functions of different parts of the system
influenced by the brain? 773. Where is sensation perceived? By what
agency are the impressions of external objects conveyed to the brain?
What is the difference between sensations and impressions? 774. Is it
known what part of the brain has the most intimate relation with the intellectual
faculties?</p>
<p>775. The brain is the seat of the <i>will</i>. It superintends the
physical as well as the mental movements, and the medium of
communication from this organ to the muscles, or the parts to
be moved, is the motor nerves. If the brain is in a quiescent
state, the muscles are at rest; if, by an act of the will,
the brain sends a portion of nervous influence to a voluntary
muscle, it immediately contracts, and those parts to which the
muscle is attached move. There is no perceptible interval
between the act of the will and the motion of the part.</p>
<p>776. Some physiologists assert, that the medulla oblongata
is the point at which excitement to motion commences, and
sensation terminates; and also, that it possesses the power of
originating motion in itself.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The medulla oblongata, unlike the brain, is
highly sensitive; if slightly punctured, convulsions follow; if
much injured, respiration, or breathing, immediately ceases.</p>
<p>777. It is remarkable that the nerves which arise from
the right side of the spinal cord communicate with the left
hemisphere of the cerebrum, and <i>vice versa</i>; this results from
the crossing of the fibres in the medulla oblongata. It follows
from this, that if the right side of the brain receives an injury,
the parts of the opposite side of the body lose their sensibility
and motion.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. If the cranial nerves which are connected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
by a single root are divided, only the sensation of the part
to which they are distributed is lost. Thus, if the optic nerve
is divided, the sense of vision disappears, but the motions of
the eye are performed as readily as before. But, if the spinal
nerves are divided, both sensation and motion of the part to
which they lead are destroyed.</p>
<p class='box'>What portions have been removed without impairing the intellect?
What is remarkable of the brain? 775. What is the influence of the brain
upon the muscles? 776. What do some physiologists assert of the medulla
oblongata? 777. What is remarkable of the nerves? Give the 1st
observation relative to the cranial nerves.</p>
<p>2d. When the spinal cord is divided or compressed, as in
fractures of the spinal column, all parts below the fracture are
paralyzed, though the nerves leading to these parts may be
uninjured.</p>
<p>3d. Again, one side of the body or one limb may become
insensible, and the power to move it, be perfectly retained; or
the reverse of this may happen&mdash;the power of motion will
be lost while sensation remains. In the former instance, the
function of the posterior, or sensitive column of the spinal cord
on one side is destroyed; in the latter, the anterior, or motor
column is affected.</p>
<p>4th. In some cases, both sensation and motion of one side
of the body or one limb are destroyed. In such instances,
both the anterior and the posterior columns of one side of
the spinal cord are diseased.</p>
<p>778. Vigorous and controllable muscular contraction requires
a sound and well-developed brain. If this organ is
defective in these particulars, the movements will be inefficient,
and may be irregular. The central organ of the nervous
system must, likewise, be in an active condition, to induce
regular, steady, and controllable muscular movements.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Persons who have suffered from apoplexy
and other severe diseases of the brain, have an involuntary
trembling of the limbs, which results from a weakened
state of the nervous system.</p>
<p class='box'>To the spinal nerves. What is said of the compression of the spinal
cord? Give the 3d observation relative to the spinal nerves. The 4th
observation. 778. Upon what does vigorous controllable muscular contraction
depend? What causes the involuntary trembling of the limbs
in persons who have suffered from apoplexy?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>2d. The tremor of the hand, that lessens the usefulness or
incapacitates the fine artist or skilful mechanic, in the prime
of life, from pursuing their vocations, may be, and is often,
induced by the influence of intoxicating drink, which debilitates
and disorganizes the brain.</p>
<p>3d. The tottering step, trembling hand, and shaking head
of the aged invalid, are the results of diminished nervous
energy, so that steady muscular contraction, so essential to
regular movements, cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>779. No difference can be discovered in the structure of
the several kinds of nerves in any part of their course, and
the functions they are designed to perform can only be known
by ascertaining the place of their origin. The nerves may
be functionally divided into five groups.</p>
<p>780. 1st. <i>Nerves of special sensation.</i> These are the first,
second, eighth, and it may be one of the branches of the fifth
pair of cranial nerves. The function of these nerves is particularly
described in the chapters upon the senses of smell,
vision, hearing, and taste.</p>
<p>781. 2d. <i>Nerves of general sensation.</i> These embrace the
fifth pair of cranial nerves, and the thirty-one pairs of spinal
nerves. In those parts that require sensation for their safety
and the performance of their functions, there is an abundant
supply of sensitive nervous filaments. The nerves of sensation
are mostly distributed upon the skin. Few filaments
ramify upon the mucous membranes and muscles.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The painful sensations experienced in
the face, and in the teeth or jaws, (tic douloureux and toothache,)
are induced by irritation and disease of a portion of
the filaments of the fifth pair of cranial nerves.</p>
<p class='box'>The tremor of the hand among some mechanics in the prime of life?
The tottering step of the aged invalid? 779. What is said relative to the
structure of the nerves? How may they be divided? 780. Give the nerves
of special sense. 781. Those of general sensation. Where are the nerves
of sensation distributed? What causes tic douloureux?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>2d. The unpleasant sensation sometimes experienced when
we hear the grating of a file or saw, is produced by the connection
of the nerve that passes across the drum of the ear
with the fifth cranial nerve.</p>
<p>3d. When pressure is made on the trunk of a nerve, the
sensibility of the part where the nerve ramifies is modified.
This is illustrated, when pressure is made upon the large
nerve of the lower extremity (sciatic) in sitting upon a hard
bench. The foot is then said to be &ldquo;asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th. When the trunk of a nerve is diseased or injured, the
pain is experienced in the outer extremity of the nerve. A
blow upon the elbow, which causes a peculiar sensation in the
little finger and one side of the ring finger, affords a familiar
illustration. This sensation is produced by injuring the ulnar
nerve, which is distributed to the little finger.</p>
<p>782. 3d. <i>Nerves of motion.</i> These are the third, sixth,
and twelfth pairs of cranial nerves, and the thirty-one pairs
of spinal nerves. These nerves are distributed to the fibres
of the five hundred muscles of the body. The functions of
the muscular are different from those of the sensitive nerves.
The former are provided for the purpose of motion, and not
of feeling. Hence, muscles may be cut, and the pain will be
slight, compared with the cutting of the skin. This may be
called muscular pain. Weariness is a sensation recognized
by one set of muscular nerves.</p>
<p>783. So uniformly is a separate instrument provided for
every additional function, that there is strong reason to regard
the muscular nerves, although running in one sheath, as in
reality double, and performing distinct functions. Sir Charles
Bell, in his work on the Nervous System, endeavors to show,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
that one set of nervous fibres conveys the mandate from the
brain to the muscle, and excites the contraction; and that
another set conveys, from the muscle to the brain, a peculiar
sense of the state or degree of contraction of the muscle, by
which we are enabled to judge of the amount of stimulus
necessary to accomplish the end desired. This is obviously
an indispensable piece of information to the mind in regulating
the movements of the body.</p>
<p class='box'>How is the peculiar sensation accounted for when we hear the grating
of a file or saw? What produces the sensation when the foot is said to
be &ldquo;asleep?&rdquo; What is the effect when the ulnar nerve is injured by a blow?
782. Give the nerves of motion. What is said of the functions of the
muscular nerves? 783. What does Sir Charles Bell endeavor to show?</p>
<p>784. 4th. <i>Nerves of respiration.</i> These are the fourth,
seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh pair of cranial nerves,
also the phrenic and the external respiratory nerve. All of
these nerves have their origin in a distinct tract or column,
called the lateral, in the upper part of the spinal cord. Hence
it is sometimes named the respiratory column. These nerves
are distributed to one of the muscles of the eye; to the muscles
of the face; to the tongue, pharynx, &oelig;sophagus, stomach,
heart, lungs, diaphragm, and some of the muscles of the neck
and chest.</p>
<p>785. It is through the instrumentality of the accessory,
phrenic, and external respiratory nerves, (10, 11, 12, 13, fig.&nbsp;132,)
that the muscles employed in respiration are brought
into action without the necessity of the interference of the
mind. Though to a certain extent they may be under the
influence of the will, yet it is only in a secondary degree. No
one can long suspend the movements of respiration;<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> for in
a short time, instinctive feeling issues its irresistible mandate,
which neither requires the aid of erring wisdom, nor brooks
the capricious interference of the will.</p>

nerves? 785. Through the agency of what nerves are the respiratory
muscles brought into action? Explain fig.&nbsp;132.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>786. The fourth, seventh, and tenth pairs of nerves, (7, 8,
9, fig.&nbsp;132,) with the spinal accessory, phrenic, and external
respiratory, are not only connected with the function of respiration,
but contribute to the expression of the passions and
emotions of the mind.</p>
<p>787. The influence of this order of nerves in the expression
of the passions, is strikingly depicted in Sir Charles Bell&rsquo;s
Treatise on the Nervous System. &ldquo;In terror,&rdquo; he remarks,
&ldquo;we can readily conceive why a man stands with his eyes
intently fixed on the object of his fears&mdash;the eyebrows elevated,
and the eyeballs largely uncovered; or why, with
hesitating and bewildered steps, his eyes are rapidly and
wildly in search of something. In this way, we only perceive
the intense application of his mind to the objects of his apprehension,
and its direct influence on the outward organs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>Can respiration be suspended for any considerable length of time?
786. What nerves contribute to the expression of the passions and emotions
of the mind? 787, 788. What does Sir Charles Bell say of the influence
of this order of nerves in the expression of the passions?</p>
<p>788. &ldquo;But when we observe him further, there is a spasm
in his breast; he cannot breathe freely; the chest remains
elevated, and his respiration is short and rapid. There is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
gasping and convulsive motion of his lips, a tremor on his
hollow cheeks, a gasping and catching of his throat; his
heart knocks at his ribs, while yet there is no force in the
circulation&mdash;the lips and cheeks being ashy pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>789. &ldquo;These nerves are the instruments of expression,
from the smile upon the infant&rsquo;s cheek, to the last agony of
life. It is when the strong man is subdued by this mysterious
influence of soul on body, and when the passions may be
truly said to tear the heart, that we have the most afflicting
picture of human frailty, and the most unequivocal proof
that it is the order of functions we have been considering,
that is thus affected. In the first struggle of the infant to
draw breath, in the man recovering from a state of suffocation,
and in the agony of passion, when the breast labors from
the influence at the heart, the same system of parts is affected,
the same nerves, the same muscles, and the symptoms or
character have a strict resemblance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>790. The seventh pair of nerves not only communicates
the purposes of the will to the muscles of the face, but at the
same time it calls them into action, under the influence of
instinct and sympathy. On this subject a late writer remarks,
&ldquo;How expressive is the face of man! How clearly it announces
the thoughts and sentiments of the mind! How well
depicted are the passions on his countenance! tumultuous
rage, abject fear, devoted love, envy, hatred, grief, and every
other emotion, in all their shades and diversities, are imprinted
there, in characters so clear that he that runs may read!
How difficult, nay, how impossible, is it to hide or falsify
the expressions which indicate the internal feelings! Thus
conscious guilt shrinks from detection, innocence declares its
confidence, and hope anticipates with bright expectation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The fifth pair of nerves (fig.&nbsp;126) is distributed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
to the parts of the face on which the seventh pair
ramifies. The former serves for sensation, the latter for
motion. Thus, when the seventh pair of nerves is divided,
or its functions destroyed by disease, the side affected loses
all power of expression, though sensation remains unaffected.
On the contrary, if we divide the fifth pair, sensation is
entirely destroyed, while expression remains.</p>
<p class='box'>789. Are they also the instruments of expression, either of joy or grief?
790. What is said in reference to the seventh pair of nerves? Where is
the fifth pair of nerves distributed?</p>
<p>791. 5th. <i>The sympathetic nerve.</i> This nerve confers vitality
on all the important portions of the system. It exerts a controlling
influence over the involuntary functions of digestion,
absorption, secretion, circulation, and nutrition. Every portion
of the body is, to a certain extent, under its influence, as
filaments from this system of nerves accompany the blood-vessels
throughout their course.</p>
<p>792. An important use of the sympathetic nerve is to
form a communication of one part of the system with another,
so that one organ can take cognizance of the condition of
every other, and act accordingly. If, for example, disease
seizes the brain, the stomach, by its sympathetic connection,
knows it; and as nourishment would add to the disease, it
refuses to receive food, and perhaps throws off what has
already been taken. Loss of appetite in sickness is thus a
kind provision of nature, to prevent our taking food when it
would be injurious; and following this intimation, we, as a
general rule, should abstain from food until the appetite returns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h3>HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>
</div>
<p>793. <span class='smcap'>As</span> the different organs of the system are dependent
on the brain and spinal cord for efficient functional action,
and as the mind and brain are closely associated during
life, the former acting in strict obedience to the laws which
regulate the latter, it becomes an object of primary importance
in education, to discover what these laws are, that
we may escape the numerous evils consequent on their
violation.</p>
<p>794. <i>For healthy and efficient action, the brain should be
primarily sound</i>; as this organ is subject to the same general
laws as other parts of the body. If the brain of the
child is free from defects at birth, and acquires no improper
impressions in infancy, it will not easily become diseased in
after life. But, if the brain has inherited defects, or has acquired
a proneness to disease by mismanagement in early life,
it will more easily yield to influences that cause diseased
action. The hereditary tendency to disease is one of the
most powerful causes that produce nervous and mental affections.
Consequently, children have a strong tendency to the
diseases from which the parents suffered.</p>
<p>795. When both parents have similar defects, or have
descended from tainted families, the children are usually more
deeply impressed with their imperfections than when only one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
possesses the defect. This is the reason of the frequency of
nervous disease and imbecility among the opulent, as intermarriages
among near relations are more frequent with this
class than among the poor.</p>
<p class='box'>793&ndash;850. <i>Give the hygiene of the nervous system.</i> 793. Why is it important
to know the laws which regulate the action of the brain?
794. What is necessary that the action of the brain be healthy and efficient?
What follows if the brain of the child has inherited defects?
795. What is the effect when both parents possess similar defects?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Among some of the reigning families of
Europe, particularly the Spanish, the folly of intermarriage
among themselves is strongly illustrated. The high and noble
talents that characterized their progenitors are not seen, but
there is now exhibited, among their descendants, imbecility
and the most revolting forms of nervous disease.</p>
<p>796. &ldquo;Unhappily, it is not merely as a cause of disease, that
hereditary predisposition is to be dreaded. The obstacles
which it throws in the way of permanent recovery are even
more formidable, and can never be entirely removed.
Safety is to be found only in avoiding the perpetuation
of the mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>797. &ldquo;Therefore, if two persons, each naturally of excitable
and delicate nervous temperament, choose to unite for life,
they have themselves to blame for the concentrated influence
of similar tendencies in destroying the health of their offspring,
and subjecting them to all the miseries of nervous
disease, madness, or melancholy.&rdquo; The command of God
not to marry within certain degrees of consanguinity, is in
accordance with the organic laws of the brain, and the
wisdom of the prohibition is confirmed by observation.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The inhabitants, females particularly, of the
sea-girt islands of America, are more affected with nervous
diseases, than those who reside upon the mainland. The
prevalence of these affections is ascribed to the frequent
intermarriage of persons closely related by blood.</p>
<p class='box'>What is one cause of nervous disease among the higher classes? What
is true of some of the reigning families of Europe? 796. Why is hereditary
predisposition to be dreaded? 797. Is the prohibition of God respecting
intermarriage in accordance with the organic laws of the brain?
What is said of the inhabitants of the sea-girt islands of America?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></div>
<p>798. <i>The brain requires a due supply of pure blood.</i> This
organ receives an unusually large supply of blood, in comparison
with the rest of the body. It is estimated that one
tenth of all the blood sent from the heart goes to this organ.
If the arterial blood be altogether withdrawn, or a person
breathes air that is filled with carbonic gas, the brain ceases
its proper action, and sensibility with consciousness becomes
extinct.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. If a person lose a considerable quantity
of blood, dizziness and loss of consciousness follow. This
results from the brain not receiving a sufficient amount of
blood to sustain its functions.</p>
<p>2d. When an individual descends into a well or pit that contains
carbonic acid, the blood is not changed or purified in
the lungs, and loss of consciousness and death soon follow.</p>
<p>799. The slighter variations in the state of the blood have
equally sure, though less palpable effects. If its vitality is
impaired by breathing an atmosphere so much vitiated as to
be insufficient to produce the proper degree of oxygenation,
the blood then affords an imperfect stimulus to the brain. As
a necessary consequence, languor and inactivity of the mental
and nervous functions ensue, and a tendency to headache,
fainting, or hysteria, makes its appearance.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Let a person remain, for a time, in a
crowded, ill-ventilated, hall or church, and headache or faintness
is generally produced. This is caused by the action of
impure blood upon the brain.</p>
<p>2d. If a school-teacher wishes to have his pupils, on the
day of examination, appear creditably, he will be careful to
have the room well ventilated. Ventilating churches might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
prevent the inattention and sleepiness that are observed
during the afternoon service.</p>
<p class='box'>798. Why does the brain require a due supply of pure blood? What is the
effect when a person loses a considerable quantity of blood? What causes
the loss of consciousness when carbonic acid is breathed? 799. What
effects are produced by slight variations in the quality of the blood? From
the following observations, give some of the effects of impure blood on
the brain.</p>
<p>3d. In many instances, the transmission of imperfectly
oxygenated blood to the brain, is an influential cause in the
production of nervous disease and delicacy of constitution.
The only efficient remedy for these conditions is a supply of
pure blood to the brain.</p>
<p>800. <i>The brain should be called into action.</i> This organ,
like the muscles, should be used, and then allowed to rest, or
cease from vigorous thought. When the brain is properly
called into action by moderate study, it increases in size and
strength; while, on the other hand, if it is not used, the
action of this organ is enfeebled, thereby diminishing the
function of all parts of the body.</p>
<p>801. The brain, being an organized part, is subject, so far
as regards exercise, to the same laws as the other organs of
the body. If it is doomed to inactivity, its size diminishes, its
health decays, and the mental operations and feelings, as a
necessary consequence, become dull, feeble, and slow. If it
is duly exercised after regular intervals of repose, the mind
acquires readiness and strength. Lastly, if it is overtasked,
either in the force or duration of its activity, its functions
become impaired, and irritability and disease take the place of
health and vigor.</p>
<p>802. The consequences of inadequate exercise will first be
explained. We have seen that by disuse the muscles become
emaciated, the bones soften, and the blood-vessels are obliterated.
The brain is no exception to this general rule. It is
impaired by permanent inactivity, and becomes less fit to
manifest the mental powers with readiness and energy. Nor
will this surprise any reflecting person, who considers that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
brain, as a part of the same animal system, is nourished by
the same blood and regulated by the same vital laws as the
muscles, bones, and arteries.</p>
<p class='box'>800. Why should the brain be called into action? 801. What is the
effect if the brain is doomed to inactivity? 802. Show the consequences of
disuse of the organs mentioned in preceding chapters. Does the same
principle apply to the brain?</p>
<p>803. It is the weakening and depressing effect which is
induced by the absence of the stimulus necessary for the
healthy exercise of the brain, that renders solitary confinement
so severe a punishment, even to the most daring minds.
Keeping the above principle in view, we shall not be surprised
to find that <i>non-exercise</i> of the brain and nervous system, or,
in other words, inactivity of intellect and feeling, is a very
frequent predisposing cause of every form of nervous disease.</p>
<p>804. For demonstrative evidence of this position, we have
only to look at the numerous victims to be found among
females of the middle and higher ranks, who have no calls to
exertion in gaining the means of subsistence, and no objects
of interest on which to exercise their mental faculties, and
who, consequently, sink into a state of mental sloth and
nervousness, which not only deprives them of much enjoyment,
but subjects them to suffering, both of body and mind
from the slightest causes.</p>
<p>805. But let the situation of such persons be changed;
bring them, for instance, from the listlessness of retirement
to the business and bustle of the city; give them a variety of
imperative employments, and so place them in society as to
supply to their cerebral organs that extent of exercise which
gives health and vivacity of action, and in a few months the
change produced will be surprising. Health, animation, and
energy, will take the place of former insipidity and dulness.</p>
<p>806. An additional illustration, involving an important principle
in the production of many distressing forms of disease
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
will be found in the case of a man of mature age, and of
active habits, who has devoted his life to the toils of business,
and whose hours of leisure have been few and short. Suppose
such a person to retire to the country in search of repose,
and to have no moral, religious, or philosophical pursuits to
occupy his attention and keep up the active exercise of his
brain; this organ will lose its health, and the inevitable result
will be, weariness of life, despondency, or some other variety
of nervous disease.</p>
<p class='box'>803. What renders solitary confinement so severe a punishment to the
most daring minds? What is a predisposing cause of nervous disease?
804. In what classes do mental and nervous debility prevail? 805. How
can this be counteracted? 806. Give another illustration, showing how
disease of the brain is induced.</p>
<p>807. One great evil attending the absence of some imperative
employment or object of interest, to exercise the mind
and brain, is the tendency which it generates to waste the
mental energies on every trifling occurrence which presents
itself, and to seek relief in the momentary excitement of any
sensation, however unworthy. The best remedy for these
evils is to create occupation to interest the mind, and give
that wholesome exercise to the brain, which its constitution
requires.</p>
<p>808. <i>The evils arising from excessive or ill-timed exercise
of the brain, or any of its parts, are numerous.</i> When we
use the eye too long, or in too bright a light, it becomes bloodshot.
The increased action of its vessels and nerves gives
rise to a sensation of fatigue and pain, requiring us to desist.
If we relieve the eye, the irritation gradually subsides and
the healthy state returns. But, if we continue to look intently,
or resume our employment before the eye has regained its
natural state by repose, the irritation at last becomes permanent,
and disease, followed by weakness of vision, or even
blindness, may ensue.</p>
<p>809. Phenomena precisely analogous occur, when, from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
intense mental excitement, the brain is kept long in a state of
excessive activity. The only difference is, that we can always
see what happens in the eye, but rarely what takes place in
the brain; occasionally, however, cases of fracture of the skull
occur, in which, part of the bone being removed, we can see
the quickened circulation in the vessels of the brain, as easily
as those of the eye.</p>
<p class='box'>807. What is one great evil attending the absence of some imperative
employment to exercise the mind and brain? What is the true remedy for
these evils? 808. From what other cause do evils arise to the brain?
Explain the evil of it by the excessive use of the eye. 809. What is the
only difference in the analogy of the phenomena of the eye and brain? Has
the analogy been verified?</p>
<p>810. Sir Astley Cooper had a young man brought to him,
who had lost a portion of his skull, just above the eyebrow.
&ldquo;On examining the head,&rdquo; says Sir Astley, &ldquo;I distinctly saw
that the pulsation of the brain was regular and slow; but at
this time he was agitated by some opposition to his wishes,
and directly the blood was sent with increased force to the
brain, and the pulsation became frequent and violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>811. Indeed, in many instances, the increased circulation
in the brain, attendant on mental excitement, reveals itself
when least expected, and leaves traces after death, which are
very perceptible. When tasked beyond its strength, the eye
becomes insensible to light, and no longer conveys any impressions
to the mind. In like manner, the brain, when much
exhausted, becomes incapable of thought, and consciousness
is almost lost in a feeling of utter confusion.</p>
<p>812. <i>At any time of life, excessive and continued mental
exertion is hurtful</i>; but in infancy and early youth, when the
structure of the brain is still immature and delicate, permanent
mischief is more easily produced by injudicious treatment
than at any subsequent period. In this respect, the
analogy is as complete between the brain and the other parts
of the body, as that exemplified in the injurious effects of premature
exercise of the bones and muscles.</p>
<p>813. Scrofulous and rickety children are the most usual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
sufferers in this way. They are generally remarkable for
large heads, great precocity of understanding, and small, delicate
bodies. But in such instances, the great size of the brain,
and the acuteness of the mind, are the results of morbid
growth. Even with the best of management, the child passes
the first years of its life constantly on the brink of active
disease.</p>
<p class='box'>810. Relate the case detailed by Sir Astley Cooper. 811. May the
increased functional action of the brain change its structure? 812. At
what age particularly is excessive and continued mental exertion hurtful?
<a name='TC_110'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">813.</ins> What is said of scrofulous and rickety children?</p>
<p>814. Instead, however, of trying to repress its mental
activity, the fond parents, misled by the early promise of
genius too often excite it still further, by unceasing cultivation,
and the never-failing stimulus of praise. Finding its
progress for a time equal to their warmest wishes, they look
forward with ecstasy to the day when its talents will break
forth and shed lustre on its name.</p>
<p>815. But in exact proportion as the picture becomes
brighter to their fancy, the probability of its being realized
becomes less; for the brain, worn out by premature exertion,
either becomes diseased, or loses its tone, leaving the mental
powers imbecile and depressed for the remainder of life. The
expected prodigy is thus easily outstripped in the social race
by many whose dull outset promised him an easy victory.</p>
<p>816. Taking for our guide the necessities of the constitution,
it will be obvious that the modes of treatment commonly
resorted to ought to be reversed. Instead of straining to the
utmost the already irritable powers of the precocious child,
and leaving his dull competitor to ripen at leisure, a systematic
attempt ought to be made, from early infancy, to rouse to action
the languid faculties of the latter, while no pains ought to be
spared to moderate and give tone to the activity of the former.</p>
<p>817. Instead of this, however, the prematurely intelligent
child is sent to school and tasked with lessons at an unusually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
early age, while the healthy but more backward boy, who
requires to be stimulated, is kept at home in idleness, perhaps
for two or three years longer, merely on account of
his backwardness. A double error is here committed. The
consequences to the intelligent boy are, frequently, the permanent
loss both of health and of his envied superiority of
intellect.</p>
<p class='box'>814. How are such children usually managed? 815. What is the cause
of their early promise and subsequent disappointment? 816. What mode
of treatment should be adopted in educating precocious children?
817. How should the dull or less active child be treated? What is the
usual course?</p>
<p>818. In youth, too, much mischief is done by the long
daily period of attendance at school, and the continued application
of the mind which the ordinary system of education
requires. The law of exercise&mdash;that long-sustained action
exhausts the vital powers of the organ&mdash;applies as well to
the brain as to the muscles. Hence the necessity of varying
the occupations of the young, and allowing frequent intervals
of exercise in the open air, instead of &ldquo;enforcing the continued
confinement now so common.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is no unusual occurrence, that on examination
day, the best scholars appear indifferently. This may be
the result of nervous exhaustion, produced by extra mental
effort in preparing for the final examination. It is advisable
for such pupils to divert their minds from close study for a
few days previous to examination. During this time, the
student may indulge in physical recreation, social intercourse,
and a moderate amount of reading.</p>
<p>819. &ldquo;In early and middle life, fever, an unusual degree
of cerebral disorder, is a common consequence of the excessive
and continued excitement of the brain. This unhappy
result is brought on by severe study, unremitted mental exertion,
anxiety, and watching. Nervous disease, from excessive
mental labor and high mental excitement, sometimes shows
itself in another form.</p>
<p class='box'>What are the consequences of the error? 818. What error prevails in the
present system of education? Why should youths be allowed frequent
intervals to exercise in the open air? Give observation. 819. What is a
frequent consequence of continued and excessive excitement of the brain?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></div>
<p>820. &ldquo;From the want of proper intervals of rest, the vascular
excitement of the brain has not time to subside. A restless
irritability of temper and disposition comes on, attended with
sleeplessness and anxiety, for which no external cause can be
assigned. The symptoms gradually become aggravated, the
digestive functions give way, nutrition is impaired, and a
sense of wretchedness is constantly present, which often leads
to attempts at suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. Moderation in mental exertion is more
necessary in old age than in early or mature years. In youth
and manhood, the exhaustion of the brain from over-excitement
may be repaired, but no such result follows over-exertion
in the decline of life. &ldquo;What is lost then, is lost forever.&rdquo;
At that period, the brain becomes excited, and is soon exhausted
when forced to protracted and vigorous thought. Sir Walter
Scott and President Harrison afford sad examples of premature
death from overtasked brains at an advanced period of
their lives.</p>
<p>2d. If the mind is incessantly engaged in the contemplation
of the same object, there is danger from over-exertion of the
brain at any period of life, but more particularly in old age.
The more limited the sphere of mental action, the greater the
danger of the brain being over-exercised. Hence the frequency
of nervous diseases in poets, mathematicians, and
musicians.</p>
<p class='box'>820. What often manifests itself from the want of proper intervals of
rest? Why is moderation in mental action necessary in old age? What
is the effect if the mind is incessantly engaged in the contemplation of the
same object?</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, CONTINUED.</h3>
</div>
<p>821. <span class='smcap'>Having</span> pointed out the evils arising both from inadequate
and from excessive mental exertion, it remains to direct
the attention to some of the rules which should guide us in
the exercise of the brain.</p>
<p>822. <i>We should not enter upon continued mental exertion,
or arouse deep feeling, immediately before or after a full
meal.</i> Such is the connection between the mind and body,
that even in a perfectly healthy person, unwelcome news,
sudden anxiety, or mental excitement, occurring soon after
eating, will impede digestion, and cause the stomach to loathe
the masticated food.</p>
<p>823. The worst forms of indigestion and nervous depression
are those which arise from excessive mental application,
or depressed feeling, conjoined with unrestrained indulgence in
the pleasures of the table. In such circumstances, the stomach
and brain react upon and disturb each other, till all the
horrors of nervous disease make their unwelcome appearance,
and render life miserable. Too many literary men and
students know this from sad experience.</p>
<p>824. <i>We should engage in intense study in the early part
of the day.</i> Nature has allotted the darkness of the night for
repose, and for restoration by sleep of the exhausted energies
of mind and body. In the early part of the evening, if study
or composition be ardently engaged in, the increased action
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
of the brain, which always accompanies activity of mind,
requires a long time to subside. If the individual possesses a
nervous temperament, he will be sleepless for hours after he
has retired, or perhaps be tormented by unpleasant dreams.</p>
<p class='box'>822. Why should we not arouse deep feeling immediately before or after
eating a full meal? 823. How are the worst forms of indigestion and nervous
depression produced? What class of men know this from sad experience?
824. What evils arise from studious application at night?</p>
<p>825. It is, therefore, of great advantage to enter upon
intense mental application early in the day, and to devote
several of the hours which precede bedtime to entertaining
conversation, music, and lighter reading. The vascular excitement
previously induced in the brain by study, has then time
to subside, and sound, refreshing sleep is much more certainly
obtained. This rule is of great consequence to those
who are obliged to undergo much mental labor.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The idea of gathering wisdom by burning
the &ldquo;midnight oil,&rdquo; is more poetical than profitable. The
best time to use the brain is during the day.</p>
<p>826. <i>The close student and the growing child need more sleep
than the idler or the adult.</i> As steep is the natural repose of
all organs, it follows that the more the brain and other organs
of the system are employed, the more repose they <a name='TC_111'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">require.</ins>
The organs of the child, beside sustaining their proper functions,
are busy in promoting its growth. This nutritive process
is attended with a certain degree of exhaustion. The impaired
health of children often results from a disregard of this principle.
But, on the other hand, an excess of sleep produces
feebleness, by preventing the proper exercise of the mind as
well as the body.</p>
<p>827. <i>The length of time the brain may be advantageously
used, is modified by many circumstances.</i> The power of the
brain in different persons to endure action, is various. This
is modified by its primary character; by development and
age; by habits of action; by the health of the cerebral organ
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
and general system; by the moral feelings and other conditions.</p>
<p class='box'>825. Why should we engage in intense study in the early part of the day?
826. What persons require the most sleep? Why? 827. What is said
relative to the length of time that the brain can be advantageously used?
Give a condition that modifies the amount of mental labor.</p>
<p>828. The primary physical organization of some individuals
is such, that they are enabled to endure with impunity
an amount of mental labor that would disorder, if not destroy
functionally, the cerebral organ of others differently
constituted. Napoleon Bonaparte was of this number. There
can be no fixed period for mental labor, that may be adopted
as a rule for all persons whose systems are maturely developed.
Much less is there a proper definite period for study, that is
applicable to all children.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The practice of retaining pupils of all ages,
from five to twenty years, in the school-room the same period of
time, for the purpose of study, is not predicated upon any law
of physiology. An exercise of three hours, with one or two
recesses of ten minutes each, may profit the eldest class; two
hours with a recess of ten minutes, the middle class; while
one hour, or one hour and a half, with one recess, would be as
long a period as the youngest pupils should be retained in the
study-room at one session.</p>
<p>829. A person who is accustomed to muscular exertion
will endure a longer period of physical toil than one who is
not inured to it. So it is with mental labor. If the brain has
been habituated to mental action and profound study, it will
not be so soon fatigued as when not accustomed to such
exertions; consequently, an amount of mental labor may be
performed with impunity at one time, that would exhaust and
cause serious disease of the cerebral organ at another.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Persons that commence a course of study
at a late period in life, frequently evince their zeal at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
commencement by poring over their books twelve or more
hours each day. The progress of such students is soon
arrested by physical and mental depression. In such instances,
it would be more judicious to commence with only three or
four hours&rsquo; vigorous application each day, and gradually protract
the period of study five or more minutes every successive
day, until the brain may be called into vigorous action six
or eight hours with impunity.</p>
<p class='box'>828. Why can there be no fixed period for mental labor? What is said
of the practice of retaining pupils of all ages the same period of time in
the school-room? 829. Show that the action of the brain is influenced by
habit, as well as the muscular system. What suggestion to those persons
that commence a course of study at a late period in life?</p>
<p>830. The amount of mental power is greatly influenced
by the general health. Such is the intimate connection of the
different parts of the system, particularly the digestive apparatus,
with the cerebral organs, that except there be vigor of
constitution, and freedom from disease, mental efforts will be
feeble and of little avail.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The prevalent opinion, that individuals who
are feeble or diseased may acquire a collegiate education, and
thus become useful to themselves and the community, is very
generally erroneous. Such persons should enter upon a daily
and systematic course of physical training, and their labor
should be in the open air, in order that the system may be
invigorated and freed from disease.</p>
<p>831. The moral feelings exert a controlling influence over
the functions of the muscular, digestive, and respiratory
organs. They also exert an influence, perhaps, more powerful
upon the nervous system. While fear and anxiety
depress, hope and the enlivening emotions, facilitate the functional
activity of the brain, and increase its power for mental
exertion. By a proper and systematic education of the
moral feelings, they are not only a source of happiness, and
productive of right conduct, but aid in the culture of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
intellect. Consequently, we should cultivate a feeling of hopeful
trust in the future, and a firm reliance upon the laws which
the Creator has given us for our guidance.</p>
<p class='box'>830. Show that the amount of mental power is modified by the general
health. What is said of feeble persons acquiring a collegiate education?
831. Do the moral feelings exert a controlling influence over the principal
functions of the system? What is the effect of a proper and systematic
culture of the moral feelings?</p>
<p>832. <i>Regularity is very important in exercising the moral
and intellectual powers.</i> Periodicity, or a tendency to resume
the same mode of action at stated times, is peculiarly the
characteristic of the nervous system. If we repeat any kind
of mental effort every day at the same hour, we at last find
ourselves entering upon it without premeditation when the
time approaches. In like manner, if we arrange our studies
in accordance with this law, and take up each in the same
order, a natural aptitude is soon produced, which renders
application more easy than by resuming the subjects as accident
may direct.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When engaged in abstruse studies, it may be
found advantageous to pursue others that are less difficult.
The intense application of the brain, which is requisite in the
one instance, is relieved by directing the attention to a study
that requires less thought. By this change, there is mental
relaxation attended with invigoration of the cerebral organ.
Or, it may be explained by assuming, that the brain is composed
of an aggregate of distinct organs, each of which is
called into action in pursuing different studies.</p>
<p>833. Effective study is impossible if the powers of the
brain are depressed. When the cerebral organ has been
temporarily debilitated by protracted intellectual efforts, it is
ineffectual to attempt any concentrated mental exercise. This
condition of the nervous system is indicated by confusion of
thought and inability to attain results that usually follow similar
efforts. Mental rest in these cases is required.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Students frequently fail in solving mathematical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
problems when the mind is prostrated by continued
and excessive effort to obtain a solution. Not unfrequently
after a night&rsquo;s rest the problem is quickly solved, and the
pupil thinks he &ldquo;dreamed it out.&rdquo; The true explanation is
rest invigorated the exhausted brain, which fitted it for vigorous
and successful thought.</p>
<p class='box'>832. Why is regularity of great importance in exercising the moral and
intellectual powers? What suggestion when pursuing abstruse studies?
How explained? 833. When is effective study impossible? How is this
condition of the nervous system indicated?</p>
<p>834. <i>The intellect should not be cultivated to the neglect
of the moral and physical powers.</i> All the faculties require
for their development regular exercise, alternated with intervals
of rest. This is as necessary to the due development
of the moral feelings of a child as in physical training and
mental culture. Consequently, those schools are to be preferred
in the education of youth, where the physical, intellectual,
and moral faculties receive each day a due share of
attention and culture.</p>
<p>835. The continuance of healthy and vigorous action in
the matured physical, mental, and moral powers, requires
frequent and regular action, alternated with rest, as much as
in their development. Consequently, those who cultivate one
or two of these faculties, to the neglect of the others, exhibit
a marked deficiency of acuteness and vigor in those not
exercised. This defect reacts on the powers that are vigorous,
diminishing the energy and deteriorating all the other
faculties of man.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. If the principles before mentioned are
true, the adult, as well as the child, should spend a part of
each day in some proper physical employment; another portion
should be appropriated to intellectual pursuits; while
another should be sedulously devoted to the cultivation of
the moral feelings.</p>
<p>2d. Disease of the corporeal system more frequently occurs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
when only one set of faculties is used than when all are
equally employed. This is particularly true of nervous and
mental disease, which follows and is caused by either high
intellectual action, or intense moral emotions, without a due
amount of physical exercise.</p>
<p class='box'>How is the &ldquo;dreaming out&rdquo; of problems explained? 834. What is said
of the culture of the intellect? What schools are preferable in the education
of youth? Why? 835. What is the effect of cultivating only one
faculty of the mind? Give observation 1st. Observation 2d.</p>
<p>836. <i>The brain can exercise its full force upon only one
object at a time.</i> If its energies are directed to two or more
operations, neither will receive that full power of exertion that
it would if only one object had engaged the mind. Although
the brain will direct several operations at the same time when
only slight mental effort is required, yet when one operation
becomes difficult, or demands special attention of the mind,
the other will be suspended. This is illustrated in social
conversation while walking. Let it become necessary to concentrate
the nervous power upon the motor organs, and the
conversation declines or ceases.</p>
<p>837. In acquiring an education, or in pursuing any profession
or trade, none of those influences that promote the proper
functions of the body, and tend to increase physical ease,
should be neglected. For, if the brain is occupied with disagreeable
sensations, it cannot concentrate its power as effectively
in the various employments of man.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The situation, ventilation, light, and
warmth of a school-room, together with the arrangement of
the benches, do much to influence the concentration or distraction
of the operations of the mind. Let there be attached
to the school-house a spacious yard planted with trees; let its
architecture be attractive; let the windows be arranged with
regularity, and not with the elevation of a convict&rsquo;s cell, and
the benches, in every respect, be adapted to the different
scholars, so that the position of each may be comfortable, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
we mistake if there is not a greater improvement, in a given
time, in such a school, than where there is an apparent disregard
to the pleasure or comfort of the scholars.</p>
<p class='box'>836. What is the effect if the brain concentrates its energies on more
than one object at a time? How illustrated? 837. What should be regarded
in pursuing any employment? Why? What is said in reference
to the arrangement of school-rooms?</p>
<p>2d. Mechanics&rsquo; shops should receive as much attention,
relative to their situation, light, warmth, &amp;c., as school-rooms.
If these are duly observed, the nervous influence transmitted
from the brain to the muscles will be more stimulating, as well
as more abundant; consequently, labor will be performed with
less exhaustion.</p>
<p>838. <i>Repetition is necessary to make a durable impression
on the mind.</i> &ldquo;The necessity of judicious repetition in mental
and moral education, is, in fact, too little adverted to,
because the principle which renders it efficacious has not been
understood. To induce facility of action in the organs of the
mind, practice is as essential as it is in the organs of motion.</p>
<p>839. &ldquo;In physical education we are aware of the advantages
of repetition. We know that if practice in dancing, fencing,
skating, and riding, is persevered in for a length of time
sufficient to give the muscles the requisite promptitude and
harmony of action, the power will be ever afterward retained,
although little called into use; whereas, if the muscles have
not been duly trained, we may reiterate practice at different
intervals, without proportionate advancement. The same principle
applies equally to the moral and intellectual powers,
because these operate by means of material organs.</p>
<p>840. &ldquo;According to this principle, it follows, that in learning
a language or science, six successive months of application
will be more effectual in fixing it in the mind and making
it a part of its furniture, than double or treble the time,
if the lessons are interrupted by long intervals. Hence it is
a great error to begin and study, and then break off, to finish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
at a later period. The fatigue is thus doubled, and the success
greatly diminished.</p>
<p class='box'>Of mechanics&rsquo; shops? 838. Is repetition necessary to make a durable
impression on the mind? Why? 839. How is it with physical education?
840. What follows, according to this principle?</p>
<p>841. &ldquo;The best way is to begin at the proper age, and to
persevere till the end is attained. This accustoms the mind
to sound exertion, and not to <i>fits</i> of attention. Hence the
evil arising from long vacations; and also the evil of beginning
studies before the age at which they can be understood, as in
teaching children the abstract rules of grammar, to succeed
in which, implies in them a power of thinking, and an amount
of general knowledge, which they do not possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>842. <i>The skull is susceptible of fractures from slight
blows.</i> This occurs most frequently when the blow is given
on the side of the head above and anterior to the ear.
Here the bone is very thin, and often quite brittle. For these
reasons, no instructor, or any person, should punish a child by
striking upon any portion of the head.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> A few years since, a teacher in one of the
Middle States gave a pupil a slight blow upon the head. It
fractured the skull and ruptured a blood-vessel of the brain,
causing a loss of consciousness, and finally death.</p>
<p>843. <i>Concussion of the brain may be produced by blows, or
by violently shaking a person.</i> As the brain is of pulpy consistence,
the atoms of which it is composed, and the circulation
of blood in its minute vessels, may be disturbed by the
vibration from a blow on the exterior of the skull-bones. This
disturbance of the cerebral organ is attended with unpleasant
sensations, dizziness, loss of memory and consciousness.
These may be followed by headache and inflammation of the
brain. Concussion of the brain, and the results above mentioned,
may be produced by the sudden motion attendant on
the violent shaking of a scholar. Consequently, a child should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
never be seized by the arm and shaken violently as a method
of chastisement.</p>
<p class='box'>841. What is the best way of learning the sciences? 842. Why should
not a child be struck upon any portion of the head? What observation
in this connection? 843. How may concussion of the brain be produced?
What is the effect of each upon the brain of the child?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Most persons have experienced a disagreeable
sensation and dizziness, caused by falling from a slight
elevation, or by jumping from a carriage. This is the result
of a moderate concussion of the brain.</p>
<p>844. In injuries of the brain, from blows and falls, the
symptoms are usually alarming, and all should possess some
information for such contingencies. In general, such accidents
are attended by insensibility; the skin and extremities
are pale and cold, the pulse is very weak and feeble, and the
circulation is less vigorous; the respiration, also, is less frequent
and full.</p>
<p>845. When these symptoms exist, the individual, in the
first instance, should be placed in pure air, and friction and
dry warmth should be applied to the pallid and cold skin.
This should be assiduously persevered in until heat and color
are restored to the skin and limbs, and due action of the heart
and arteries has been established. Mild stimulants may also
be used internally, with much advantage. The sympathizing
friends should not be permitted to stand about the patient, as
they vitiate the air. There should be no bleeding until the
skin and extremities become warm. Send for a surgeon without
delay.</p>
<p class='box'>Give an instance where moderate concussion of the brain is produced.

<a name='CHAPTER_XLI_THE_SENSE_OF_TOUCH' id='CHAPTER_XLI_THE_SENSE_OF_TOUCH'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<h3>THE SENSE OF TOUCH.</h3>
</div>
<p>846. <span class='smcap'>Sensation</span> is the perception of external objects by
means of the senses. There are five senses, namely, <i>Touch</i>,
<i>Taste</i>, <i>Smell</i>, <i>Hearing</i>, and <i>Vision</i>.</p>
<p>847. <span class='smcap'>Touch</span> is the sense by which the mind becomes acquainted
with some of the properties of bodies, and enables
us determine whether their surfaces are smooth or rough,
their relative temperature, and, to a certain degree, their form
and weight.</p>
<p>848. Some physiologists make a distinction between the
sense of touch and tact. Tact, or feeling, is more general,
extending over the whole surface of the skin and mucous
membranes, while touch exists chiefly in the fingers of man
and in the noses of certain quadrupeds.</p>
<p>849. &ldquo;In the exercise of these functions, tact is considered
passive; as, when any part of the system comes into contact
with another body, a sensation of its presence is given, without
the exercise of volition. On the contrary, touch is active,
and is exercised voluntarily, for the purpose of conveying to
the mind a knowledge of the qualities or properties of the
surfaces of bodies; as when we feel of a piece of cloth to
ascertain its qualities, or a polished surface, to prove its
smoothness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>850. In man, the hand is admirably adapted to the exercise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
of touch. &ldquo;The fineness of the skin, its great sensibility, the
species of cushion formed by the sub-cutaneous fat at the
extremities of the fingers, the length and flexibility of these
organs, and the capability of opposing the thumb to the fingers,
like a pair of forceps, are so many conditions essentially favorable
to the delicacy of this sense, and enable us to appreciate
with exactitude the qualities of the bodies we may feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='box'>846. Define sensation. How many senses have we? 847&ndash;851. <i>What is
said of the sense of touch?</i> 847. Define touch. 848. What is the difference
between touch and tact? 849. In the exercise of these functions, which is
active, and which passive? 850. Why is the hand so admirably adapted
to the exercise of the sense of touch?</p>
<p>851. The nerves that supply the sense of touch, proceed
from the anterior half of the spinal cord. Where this sense
is most acute and delicate, we find the greatest number of
sensitive nervous filaments, and those of the largest size.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In amputating limbs, and other surgical operations,
the division of the skin causes more pain than all the
subsequent steps of the operation, however protracted. The
muscles, cellular membrane, and fat have but little sensibility;
while the bones, tendons, and ligaments are insensible when
not diseased, and may be cut without causing pain.</p>
<p>HYGIENE OF THE SENSE OF TOUCH.</p>
<p>852. The sense of touch varies in different persons, and
also in individuals of different ages. Thus the sensibilities of
the child are more acute than those of the aged. Although
there is an original difference of sensibility from organization,
still, the function of the nerves of sensation is modified by
certain influences.</p>
<p>853. <i>The healthy or unhealthy, active or inactive state of
the brain, influences the action of the sensitive nerves.</i> In
sound and perfect sleep, the brain is inactive. In this state,
ordinary impressions made upon the skin are not observed by
the sleeping person. Thus the arm may be blistered while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
sleeping, when exposed to the warm rays of the sun, and the
individual will not be aware of it at the time.</p>
<p class='box'>851. From what do the nerves proceed that supply this sense? 852&ndash;864.
<i>Give the hygiene of the sense of touch.</i> 852. Does this sense vary in
different persons? 853. Mention a condition of the brain that influences
the nerves of sensation.</p>
<p>854. If there is compression of the brain, as when the
skull-bones are depressed, or disease of this organ exists, as
in severe typhus fever, impressions made upon the nerves of
the skin will not be noticed. The same is true when the
mind is engaged in intense thought or study; heat or cold may
be so intense as to disorganize the skin, and not to be noticed.</p>
<p>855. The varying health or condition of the brain usually
depresses or increases the sensitiveness of the skin. This is
seen in grief and fear, which diminish, while hope and joy
increase the impressibility of this tissue. It is not uncommon
to see the unfortunate insane endure exposure to heat and
cold with seeming impunity; whereas it would induce almost
insupportable suffering to the sane man. Diseases of the
heart, stomach, and lungs, alter the condition of the brain,
and modify, to a greater or less degree, the sensitiveness of
the skin.</p>
<p>856. <i>The state of the conducting nervous trunks influences
the nerves of sensation.</i> If a nervous trunk is compressed or
divided, the parts supplied by nervous filaments from this
branch, will be insensible to the impressions made upon them,
and consequently such impressions are not transmitted to the
brain.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the inside of the arm or lower extremities
rests upon a hard surface, the nerves may be compressed
so as to deprive the parts of sensibility. This condition is
called &ldquo;numbness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>857. <i>The quantity of blood supplied to the skin modifies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
its sensitiveness.</i> If the quantity of blood is diminished, the
sensibility of the skin will be impaired. This is demonstrated
by noting the effects of cold upon the cutaneous tissue, the
application of which contracts the blood-vessels, and drives the
circulating fluid from this membrane, which is shown by the
paleness, as well as by the shrivelled appearance of the skin.
And, if this tissue is wounded while under the influence of
cold, but little pain will be felt, and this chilling influence may
be carried so far as not only to deprive the part of sensation,
but of vitality.</p>
<p class='box'>854. Mention other conditions that affect these nerves. 855. What is
the effect of the varying health or condition of the brain upon the sensitiveness
of the skin? Give instances of this effect. 856. What is the
result if a nervous trunk is divided or compressed? How may &ldquo;numbness&rdquo;
in the limbs be produced? 857. Does the quantity of blood supplied
to the skin affect its sensibility?</p>
<p>858. The influence of the blood upon the sensibility of the
skin, is further demonstrated by the pain experienced when
chilled extremities are suddenly exposed to heat. The nerves,
by the sudden dilatation of the contracted blood-vessels, are put
in vivid and rapid motion, which causes the painful and tingling
sensation that we experience. In every part of the system,
sudden changes produce unpleasant sensations, and frequently
a diseased condition of the organs.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the hands, or other portions of the
body, are frozen, or severely chilled, safety and comfort demand
that circulation be restored to the parts by moderate
exercise in a cool room. Not unfrequently, the vitality of the
limb is destroyed by immersing it in hot water or holding it
near the fire.</p>
<p>859. <i>The quality of the blood also influences sensation.</i> If
the brain and other parts of the nervous system receive impure
blood, their energy is depressed, and the sensibility of the skin
rendered more or less obtuse.</p>
<p>860. <i>The condition of the cuticle modifies the impression
made upon the cutaneous nerves.</i> 1st. When the cuticle has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
become thick and hard, like horn, as on the inside of the
mason&rsquo;s hand, it enables him to ply his tools without much
suffering, because the thickened cuticle diminishes the impressions
made upon the nerves.</p>
<p class='box'>How is it demonstrated? 858. How is the influence of the blood upon
the skin further demonstrated? How should circulation be restored to
limbs frozen or severely chilled? What should be avoided? 859. Show
how the quality of the blood influences sensation. 860. Give the 1st condition
of the cuticle that influences the impressions made on the cutaneous
nerves.</p>
<p>861. 2d. When the cuticle is very thin and delicate, as on
the hand of the lady who is unaccustomed to manual labor. Let
her pursue some manual employment for several hours, and
the extreme tenuity, or thinness of the cuticle, will not protect
the nerves and parts below from becoming irritated and
inflamed.</p>
<p>862. 3d. When the cuticle is removed by blistering or
abrasion, the pain indicates that the naked nerves are too
powerfully stimulated by the contact of external bodies.
4th. When the cuticle is coated with impurities, blended with
the secretion from the oil-glands, the sensibility of the skin
is lessened.</p>
<p>863. <i>The sensibility of the cutaneous nerves is modified by
being habituated to impressions.</i> If, for example, an individual
should immerse his feet in moderately warm water, at
first it might induce a smarting sensation; in a short time, the
nerves would not only become habituated to the warm water,
but its warmth night be considerably increased. The same
results follow, if an individual is exposed to a cold element.
The impressions at first are highly disagreeable; but as soon
as the nerves become accustomed to the surrounding atmosphere,
it may impart the most agreeable sensations.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> 1st. Let a person from the tropical regions go
to a colder climate, and the cool mornings of the latter will at
first affect him unpleasantly; but, after a few days&rsquo; exposure
to the cooler air, the sensation will be far from disagreeable.</p>
<p>2d. Let a person enter a room moderately heated; gradually
increase the temperature, until it attains extreme summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
heat; not only the cutaneous nerves, but the whole
system, become habituated to the high temperature. From
these facts we learn that the sensations, are not always a correct
index of the real temperature. A well-adjusted thermometer
will indicate it with unerring certainty.</p>
<p class='box'>861. The 2d condition. 862. The 3d and 4th condition. 863. Show how
habit influences the sensibility of the cutaneous nerves. Give illustration
1st. Illustration 2d.</p>
<p>864. <i>Touch is modified, in a high degree, by education.</i>
Thus the blind, whose &ldquo;windows of the soul&rdquo; are closed to
the beauties of the external world, cultivate this sense to such
a degree that they can distinguish objects with great accuracy.
And the rapidity with which they read books prepared for
their use, is a convincing proof of the niceness and extent to
which the cultivation of this sense can be carried.</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. The cloth-dresser, by the aid of this
sense, distinguishes the quality, as well as the slightest difference
of texture, in the different pieces of cloth.</p>

<p>865. <span class='smcap'>The</span> chief organ of <span class='smcaplc'>TASTE</span> is the upper surface of the
tongue; though the lips, the palate, the internal surface of
the cheeks, and the upper part of the oesophagus, participate
in this function.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF TASTE.</h3>
</div>
<p>866. The tongue is a double organ, composed chiefly of
muscular fibres, which run in almost every direction. The
two sides are so perfectly distinct, that sometimes, in paralysis,
one side is affected, while the function of the other remains
perfect. It possesses great versatility of motion, and can be
moulded into a great variety of shapes. In articulation,
mastication, and deglutition, the tongue is an auxiliary to
other organs.</p>
<p>867. This organ is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels,
having a large artery sent to each side of it. It is also very
largely furnished with nerves; it receives nervous filaments
from the fifth, ninth, and twelfth pairs of nerves. The branch
of the fifth, called the gustatory, is the nerve of taste and

motion. By means of the ninth, called the glosso-pharyngeal
the tongue is brought into association with the fauces, &oelig;sophagus,
and larynx. It is of obvious importance that these
parts should act in concert; and this is effected by the distribution
of this nerve.</p>

<a name='TC_112'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">fig.</ins> 134.</p>
<p>868. The surface of the tongue is thickly studded with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
fine papill&aelig;, or <i>vil&acute;li</i>, which give the organ a velvety appearance.
These papill&aelig; are of three varieties. The first is
situated near the base of the tongue. They belong to the
class of mucous follicles. They are larger than the others,
and are called <i>len-tic&acute;u-lar</i>, from being shaped like a lens.
These, together with the tonsils, (sometimes called the almonds
of the ears,) secrete mucus, to lubricate the food in the act
of deglutition.</p>
<p>869. The instruments of taste are the two other sets of
papill&aelig;. One set consists of small, oval-shaped bodies, which
are scattered over the whole surface of the tongue. They
give it a rough appearance, and are called the <i>fil&acute;i-form</i>
papill&aelig;.</p>
<p>870. The other set of papill&aelig; is called the <i>fun&acute;gi-form</i>.
They are larger than the former, and consist of small,
rounded heads, supported on short stalks, something in the
shape of mushrooms, from which they derive their name.
In the last two described sets of sensitive papill&aelig;, the gustatory
branch of the fifth pair of nerves ramifies.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> By applying strong acids, as vinegar, to the
tongue, with a hair pencil, these points will become curiously
lengthened.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ORGANS OF TASTE.</h3>
</div>
<p>871. <span class='smcap'>Taste</span> is the sense which makes us acquainted with
the savor of substances. When fluids are taken into the
mouth, the papill&aelig; dilate and erect themselves, and the particular
impression excited is transmitted to the brain through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
filaments of the gustatory nerve. This sense is closely
connected with that of smell. The pleasures derived from
it are strictly sensual and corporeal, and contribute in no
way to the expansion of the mind, like those of hearing and
seeing.</p>
<p class='box'>How many varieties of papill&aelig;? Describe the first variety. What
is the function of the lenticular papill&aelig;? 869. Describe the filiform
papill&aelig;. 870. The fungiform papill&aelig;? What nerve ramifies in the fungiform
papill&aelig;? How can these papill&aelig;, or points, be seen? <a name='TC_113'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">871&ndash;875.</ins>
<i>Give the physiology of the organs of taste.</i> 871. Define taste.</p>
<p>872. If dry, solid food is taken, the tongue carries it to
the back side of the mouth, where it receives secretions from
the salivary glands; the saliva, becoming impregnated with
its flavor, flows over the sides of the tongue, and gives to the
papill&aelig; a perception of the savory juice; this impression is
then communicated to the brain.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is supposed that the salts which enter into
the composition of the saliva, are very efficient agents in
reducing substances to a proper state for making impressions
on the nerves of taste. The fact that metals impart a peculiar
taste, is owing to a galvanic shock, and not properly to what we
understand by taste.</p>
<p>873. The primary use of taste is to guide animals in the
selection of food, and to warn them against the introduction
of noxious articles into the stomach. In all the inferior animals,
we see that the original design of taste is still answered.
But in man, this sense has been so abused and perverted, by
the introduction of stimulants and condiments, and the endless
admixture of different articles of food, that the simple
action of this part seems to have been superseded almost
entirely by acquired taste.</p>
<p>874. In children, this sense is usually acute, and their
preference is for food of the mildest character. And it is
also true, that every person has some peculiarities of taste,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
or dislikes to particular articles of food. This may be either
constitutional or from the influence of association.</p>
<p class='box'>With what sense is this closely connected? What is said of this
sense? 872. Give the process by which we taste substances. How can we
account for the taste of metals when applied to the tongue? 873. What
is the primary use of taste? Where do we see it perverted? 874. How
is this sense in children? What is true of every person in reference to
taste?</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> This sense has been made to vary more than
any other by the refinements of social life. Thus, the Indian&rsquo;s
like or dislike to particular kinds of food, generally extends
to every person of the same tribe; but among civilized men,
no two individuals can be found alike in all their tastes.</p>
<p>875. This sense is modified by habit, and not unfrequently
those articles, which at first were disgusting, become highly
agreeable by persevering in the use of them. By cultivation,
this sense may be made very acute. Those persons
whose business leads them to judge of the quality of an
article by their taste, can discriminate shades of flavor not
perceivable by ordinary persons. Epicures, and tasters of
wines and teas, afford examples.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Many persons impair their taste by bad
habits, as chewing and smoking tobacco, and using stimulating
drinks, and pungent condiments with the food. These
indulgences lessen the sensibility of the nerve, and destroy
the natural relish for food.</p>
<p class='box'>What is true of the Indian? 875. Is this sense modified by habit? Give
instances. How is this sense sometimes impaired?</p>

<h3>SENSE OF SMELL.</h3>
</div>
<p>876. <span class='smcap'>This</span> sense is located in the air-passages of the <i>Nose</i>.
To understand the function of smell, the structure of the nose
and nasal cavities, with the distribution of the olfactory nerves,
must be first examined.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF SMELL.</h3>
</div>
<p>877. The <span class='smcaplc'>NOSE</span> is composed of the <i>Bones</i>, <i>Fi&acute;bro-car&acute;tilages</i>,
and <i>Mu&acute;cous Mem&acute;brane</i>, together with its integuments.</p>
<p>878. The <span class='smcaplc'>BONES</span> of the nose are the nasal, and the nasal
processes of the upper jaw.</p>
<p>879. The <span class='smcaplc'>FIBRO-CARTILAGES</span> give form and stability to the
framework of the nose, providing at the same time, by their
elasticity, against injuries. They are five in number.</p>
<p>880. The <span class='smcaplc'>MUCOUS MEMBRANE</span>, which lines the interior of
the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with the
lining membrane of the parts of the throat. The entrance of
the nostrils is provided with numerous hairs, which serve as
guardians to the delicate membrane of the nose.</p>
<p>881. The <span class='smcap'>NASAL FOSS&AElig;</span>, or nostrils, are two irregular, compressed
cavities, extending from the nose to the pharynx.
These cavities are bounded superiorly by the sphenoid and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
ethmoid bones; inferiorly, by the hard palate. In the middle
line they are separated from each other by a bony and fibro-cartilaginous
septum; upon the outer wall of each fossa, in
the dried skull, are three projecting processes, termed spongy
bones. In the fresh fossa, these are covered by a mucous
membrane.</p>

the nasal cavities.</p>
<p>882. The space that intervenes between the superior and
middle spongy bone, is called the <i>superior me-a&acute;tus</i>, or channel;
the space between the middle and inferior bone, is the
<i>middle meatus</i>; and that between the inferior bone and the
floor of the fossa, is the <i>inferior meatus</i>.</p>

<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ORGANS OF SMELL.</h3>
</div>
<p>885. The sense of smell enables us to discern the odor or
scent of any thing. When substances are presented to the
nose, the air that is passing through the nostrils brings the
odoriferous particles of matter in contact with the filaments
of the olfactory nerves, that are spread upon the membrane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
that lines the air-passages, and the impression is then transmitted
to the brain.</p>
<p class='box'>884. What nerves ramify upon this membrane? What is represented by
fig.&nbsp;136? 885&ndash;899. <i>Give the physiology of the organs of smell.</i> 885. How
does the mind become sensible of odoriferous particles?</p>
<p>886. This sense, with that of taste, aids man as well as the
inferior animals, in selecting proper food, and it also gives us
pleasure by the inhalation of agreeable odors. The sense of
smell, like that of taste and touch, may be improved by cultivation.
It likewise varies in different persons.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Sometimes this sense seems to possess a
morbid degree of acuteness in respect to odors, which is highly
inconvenient and even dangerous. With some individuals, the
smell of certain fruits, flowers, cheese, &amp;c., produce nausea
and even convulsions.</p>
<p>887. In the inferior animals generally, the sense of smell
is more acute than in man. Thus the bloodhound will track
the hare over the ground for miles, guided only by the odor
that it leaves in its flight. He also traces the progress of
his master through thickly-crowded streets, distinguishing his
footsteps from those of a thousand others, and amidst the
odorous particles emanating from a thousand sources.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In some of the higher orders of the inferior
animals, there is an astonishing acuteness of smell in regard to
effluvia that come from living animals. To these animals, it
possesses an importance in them far beyond what it has in
man, by making them acquainted with the presence of their
enemies or their prey, when the eye and ear are incapable
of acting. It is related by travellers in Africa, that they were
always apprised of lions in their vicinity during the night, by
the moans and tremblings of their horses.</p>
<p>888. Smell is somewhat under the control of the will. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
is, we have the power of receiving or rejecting odors that are
presented; thus, if odors are agreeable, we inspire forcibly, to
enjoy them; but, if they are offensive, our inspirations are
more cautious, or we close our nostrils. This sense is likewise
modified by habit; odors which, in the first instance,
were very offensive, may not only become endurable, but
even agreeable.</p>
<p class='box'>886. What is the use of the sense of smell? Can this sense be improved
by cultivation? What is said respecting this sense in some
individuals? 887. What is said of this sense in the bloodhound? Mention
an instance of astonishing acuteness of smell in some of the higher
orders of animals. 888. Show that smell is somewhat under the control
of the will.</p>
<p>889. Acuteness of smell requires that the brain and nerve
of smell be healthy, and that the membrane that lines the nose
be thin and moist. Any influence that diminishes the sensibility
of the nerves, thickens the membrane, or renders it dry,
impairs this sense.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. <i>Snuff</i>, when introduced into the nose,
not only diminishes the sensibility of the nervous filaments,
but thickens the lining membrane. This thickening of the
membrane obstructs the passage of air through the nostrils,
and thus obliges &ldquo;snuff-takers&rdquo; to open their mouths when
they breathe.</p>
<p>2d. The mucous membrane of the nasal passages is the
seat of chronic catarrh. This affection is difficult of removal,
as remedial agents cannot easily be introduced into the windings
of these passages. Snuff and many other articles used
for catarrh, produce more disease than they remove.</p>
<p class='box'>889. On what does acuteness of smell depend? What effect has snuff
when introduced into the nose? What is said of chronic catarrh?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<h3>SENSE OF VISION.</h3>
</div>
<p>890. <span class='smcap'>This</span> sense contributes more to the enjoyment and
happiness of man than any other of the senses. By it we
perceive the form, color, volume, and position of objects that
surround us. The eye is the organ of sight, or vision, and its
mechanism is so wonderful, that it not only proves the existence
of a great First Cause, but perhaps, more than other
organs, the design of the Creator to mingle pleasure with our
existence.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF VISION.</h3>
</div>
<p>891. The apparatus of vision consists of the <i>Op&acute;tic Nerve</i>,
the <i>Globe</i> and <i>Muscles</i> of the eye, and its <i>Protecting Organs</i>.</p>
<p>892. The <span class='smcaplc'>OPTIC NERVE</span> arises by two roots from the central
portion of the base of the brain. The two nerves approach
each other, as they proceed forward, and some of the
fibres of each cross to the nerve of the opposite side. They
then diverge, and enter the globe of the eyes at their back
part, where they expand, and form a soft, whitish membrane.</p>
<p>893. The <span class='smcaplc'>GLOBE</span>, or ball of the eye, is an optical instrument
of the most perfect construction. The sides of the globes
are composed of <i>Coats</i>, or membranes. The interior of the
globe is filled with refracting <i>Humors</i>, or <i>me&acute;di-ums</i>.</p>

<p>896. The <span class='smcaplc'>SCLEROTIC COAT</span> is a dense, fibrous membrane
and invests about four fifths of the globe of the eye. It gives
form to this organ, and serves for the attachment of the muscles
that move the eye in various directions. This coat, from
the brilliancy of its whiteness, is known by the name of &ldquo;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
white of the eye.&rdquo; Anteriorly, the sclerotic coat presents a
bevelled edge, which receives the cornea in the same way that
a watch-glass is received by the groove in its case.</p>
<p class='box'>894. Name the coats of the eye. 895. Name the humors of the eye.
Explain fig.&nbsp;137. 896. Describe the sclerotic coat.</p>
<p>897. The <span class='smcaplc'>CORNEA</span> is the transparent projecting layer, that
forms the anterior fifth of the globe of the eye. In form, it
is circular, convexo-concave, and resembles a <a name='TC_116'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">watch-glass.</ins>
It is received by its edge, which is sharp and thin, within the
bevelled border of the sclerotic, to which it is firmly attached.
The cornea is composed of several different layers; its
blood-vessels are so small that they exclude the red particles
altogether, and admit nothing but serum.</p>
<p>898. The <span class='smcaplc'>CHOROID COAT</span> is a vascular membrane, of a rich
chocolate-brown color upon its external surface, and of a deep
black color within. It is connected, externally, with the sclerotic,
by an extremely fine cellular tissue, and by the passage
of nerves and vessels; internally, it is in contact with the
retina. The choroid membrane is composed of three layers.
It secretes upon its internal surface a dark substance, called
<i>pig-ment&acute;um ni&acute;grum</i>, which is of great importance in the
function of vision.</p>
<p>899. The <span class='smcaplc'>IRIS</span> is so called from its variety of color in different
persons. It forms a partition between the anterior and
posterior chambers of the eye, and is pierced by a circular
opening, which is called the <i>pu&acute;pil</i>. It is composed of two
layers. The radiating fibres of the anterior layer converge
from the circumference to the centre. Through the action of
these radiating fibres the pupil is dilated. The circular fibres
surround the pupil, and by their action produce contraction of
its area. The posterior layer is of a deep purple tint, and is
called <i>u-ve&acute;a</i>, from its resemblance in color to a ripe grape.</p>
<p class='box'>How are this coat and the cornea united? 897. Describe the cornea.
898. What is the color of the external surface of the choroid coat? Of
the internal? How is it connected externally? How internally? What

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></div>
<p>900. The <span class='smcaplc'>CILIARY PROCESSES</span> consist of a number of triangular
folds, formed, apparently, by the plaiting of the internal
layer of the choroid coat. They are about sixty in number.
Their external border is continuous with the internal layer of
the choroid coat. The central border is free, and rests against
the circumference of the crystalline lens. These processes
are covered by a layer of the pigmentum nigrum.</p>

</div>
<p>901. The <span class='smcaplc'>RETINA</span> is composed of three layers: The external;
middle, or nervous; and internal, or vascular. The
external membrane is extremely thin, and is seen as a flocculent
film, when the eye is suspended in water. The nervous
membrane is the expansion of the optic nerve, and forms a
thin, semi-transparent, bluish-white layer. The vascular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
membrane consists of the ramifications of a minute artery and
its accompanying vein. This vascular layer forms distinct
sheaths for the nervous papill&aelig;, which constitute the inner
surface of the retina.</p>
<p class='box'>900. How are the ciliary processes formed? What does fig.&nbsp;138 exhibit?
901. Of how many layers is the retina composed? Describe the external
layer. The nervous layer.</p>
<p>902. The <span class='smcaplc'>AQUEOUS HUMOR</span> is situated in the anterior and
posterior chambers of the eye. It is an albuminous fluid,
having an alkaline reaction. Its specific gravity is a very little
greater than distilled water. The anterior chamber is the
space intervening between the cornea, in front, and the iris
and pupil, behind. The posterior chamber is the narrow
space, less than half a line in depth, bounded by the posterior
surface of the iris and pupil, in front, and by the ciliary processes
and crystalline lens, behind. The two chambers are
lined by a thin layer, the secreting membrane of the aqueous
humor.</p>
<p>903. The <span class='smcaplc'>CRYSTALLINE HUMOR</span>, or lens, is situated immediately
behind the pupil, and is surrounded by the ciliary
processes. This humor is more convex on the posterior than
on the anterior surface, and, in different portions of the surface
of each, the convexity varies from their oval character.
It is imbedded in the anterior part of the vitreous humor, from
which it is separated by a thin membrane, and is invested by
a transparent elastic membrane, called the capsule of the lens.
The lens consists of concentric layers, disposed like the coats
of an onion. The external layer is soft, and each successive
one increases in firmness until the central layer forms a hardened
nucleus. These layers are best demonstrated by boiling,
or by immersion in alcohol, when they separate easily from
each other.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The lens in the eye of a fish is round,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>

lens, or its investing membrane, is changed in structure?</p>
<p>2d. When the crystalline lens, or its investing membrane,
is changed in structure, so as to prevent the rays of light passing
to the retina, the affection is called a <i>cataract</i>.</p>

<p>904. The <span class='smcaplc'>VITREOUS HUMOR</span> forms the principal bulk of the
globe of the eye. It is an albuminous fluid, resembling the
aqueous humor, but is more dense, and differs from the aqueous
in this important particular, that it has not the power
of re-producing itself. If by accident it is discharged, the eye
is irrecoverably lost; while the aqueous humor may be let out,
and will be again restored. It is enclosed in a delicate membrane,
called the <i>hy&acute;a-loid</i>, which sends processes into the
interior of the globe of the eye, forming the cells in which
the humor is retained.</p>

<p>905. The <span class='smcaplc'>MUSCLES</span> of the eye are six in number. They
are attached, at one extremity, to the bones of the orbit behind
the eye; at the other extremity, they are inserted by broad,
thin tendons, near the junction of the cornea with the sclerotic
coat. The white, pearly appearance of the eye is caused by
these tendons.</p>

<p>906. The <span class='smcaplc'>PROTECTING ORGANS</span> are the <i>Or&acute;bits</i>, <a name='TC_119'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added ','"><i>Eyebrows</i>,</ins>
<i>Eyelids</i>, and <i>Lach&acute;ry-mal Apparatus</i>.</p>
<p>907. The <span class='smcaplc'>ORBITS</span> are deep, bony sockets, in which the
globes of the eyes are situated. They have the form of a
cone, the base of which is open and directed forward. The
bottom of the orbits is pierced by a large hole which gives
passage to the optic nerve. These cavities are lined with a
thick cushion of fat, in order that the eyes may move in all
directions, with perfect freedom and without friction.</p>
<p>908. The <span class='smcaplc'>EYEBROWS</span> are two projecting arches of integument,
covered with short, thick hairs, which form the upper
boundary of the <a name='TC_120'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">orbits.</ins> The eyebrows are so arranged that
they prevent the moisture that accumulates on the forehead,
in free perspiration, from flowing into the eye, and also shade
these organs from too vivid light.</p>
<p>909. The <span class='smcaplc'>EYELIDS</span> are two movable curtains placed in
front of the eye. They have a delicate skin on the outside,
muscular fibres beneath, and a narrow cartilage on their edges,
which tends to preserve the shape of the lid. Internally, they
are lined by a smooth membrane, which is reflected over the
front of the eye upon the sclerotica. This membrane is called
the <i>con-junc-ti&acute;va</i>. It secretes the fluid that moistens and lubricates
the eye, and which causes the eyelids to open and shut
without friction.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When the portion of this membrane that
is reflected over the globe of the eye, is inflamed, there is
frequently a deposition of whitish material, called lymph. This
accounts for the films, opacities, and white spots seen upon
the eye after the inflammation has subsided.</p>
<p class='box'>906. Name the protecting organs of the eye. 907. Describe the orbits.
How are the movements of the eye facilitated? 908. Describe the eyebrows.

What is the use of the conjunctiva? How are the white spots frequently
seen upon the eye accounted for?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span></div>
<p>910. There are found several small glands on the internal
surface of the cartilage, which have the appearance of
parallel strings of pearls. They open by minute apertures
upon the edges of the lids. The secretion from these glands
prevents the edges of the eyelids from being united during
sleep.</p>
<p>911. The edges of the eyelids are furnished with a triple
row of long, thick hairs, called <i>eyelashes</i>, which curve upward
from the upper lid, and downward from the lower, so that
they may not interlace with each other in the closure of the
eyelids. These appendages of the eye, by closing, not
only protect it from moisture, but from dust, particularly
during sleep. They likewise, by their movements in opening
and shutting, spread the lubricating fluid equally over
the eye.</p>
<p>912. The <span class='smcaplc'>LACHRYMAL APPARATUS</span>, which secretes the tears,
consists of the <i>Lachrymal Gland</i> with its ducts, <i>Lachrymal
Canals</i>, and the <i>Nasal Duct</i>.</p>
<p>913. The <span class='smcaplc'>LACHRYMAL GLAND</span> is situated at the upper and
outer angle of the orbit. It is about three quarters of an inch
in length, flattened and oval in shape, and occupies a depression
in the orbital plate of the frontal bone. Ten or twelve
small ducts pass from this gland, and open upon the upper
eyelid, where they pour upon the conjunctiva the lachrymal
fluid, or tears. This secretion is maintained while we are
asleep, as well as when we are awake. The eye from this
cause is kept constantly moist.</p>
<p>914. The <span class='smcaplc'>LACHRYMAL CANALS</span> commence at minute openings
upon the free borders of each eyelid, near the internal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
angle of the eye, by two small orifices, called <i>punc&acute;ta lach-ry-ma&acute;li-a</i>,
(tear points.) Each of these points communicate
with the sac at the upper part of the nasal duct.</p>
<p class='box'>910. What are found on the internal surface of the cartilage of the eyelids?

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ORGANS OF VISION.</h3>
</div>
<p>917. <span class='smcap'>To</span> comprehend the theory of vision, it is not sufficient
to know the structure of the eye. We must be familiar
with some of the properties of a subtile fluid, which is constantly
emanating from all luminous bodies, called <i>light</i>.</p>
<p>918. It is the province of natural philosophy, rather than
physiology, to enter minutely upon the properties of light.
It may be observed, however, that, when light passes through
any medium of the same density, the rays are in straight
lines; but, when it passes from one medium into another of
different density, it is refracted, or turned from a straight
course, unless it strikes the medium in a perpendicular
direction&mdash;then light passes through without a change of
direction.</p>
<p>919. When a ray of light meets with a body, it either
passes through it, or is reflected by it, or it may be absorbed.
Again, in proportion as the rays of light become distant from
the body from which they emanate, they diverge one from
the other. In accordance with the laws of optics, the rays
of light, in passing through an optical instrument like the eye,
must cross each other, and thus produce an inverted image
of the object from which the rays proceed. With the general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
view of the structure of the eye, we will now examine the
use of each part in the function of vision.</p>
<p class='box'>917&ndash;933. <i>Give the physiology of the organs of vision.</i> 917. What is necessary
in order to understand the theory of vision? 918. When light passes
through a medium of the same density, in what direction will be its rays?
Of a different density? What exception? 919. When light meets with
a body, what takes place? What is said in reference to rays of light in
passing through the eye?</p>
<p>920. The sclerotic coat not only gives form to the body
of the eye, but protection to the interior and more delicate
parts. The choroid coat seems to be chiefly composed of a
tissue of nerves and minute blood-vessels; the latter give
nourishment to the different parts of the eye. One of the
uses of this coat is, to absorb the rays of light immediately
after they have passed through the retina. This is effected
by the black pigment that lines its inner surface. Were it
not for this provision, light would be too intense, and vision
indistinct.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In albinos, where there is an absence of the
black pigment, the rays of light traverse the iris, and even
the choroid coat, and so overwhelm the eye with light, that
their vision is quite imperfect, except in the dimness of
evening, or at night. In the manufacture of optical instruments,
care is taken to color their interior black, for the same
object, namely, the absorption of scattered rays.</p>
<p>921. The iris, by means of its powers of expansion and
contraction, regulates the quantity of light admitted through
the pupil. If the iris is thin, and the rays of light pass
through its substance, they are immediately absorbed by the
uvea, and, if that layer be insufficient, they are taken up by
the black pigment of the choroid coat.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When we look toward the bottom of the eye,
the pupil appears like a black spot, instead of an opening.
This is caused by seeing the black pigment through the retina
and humors of the eye.</p>
<p class='box'>920. What is the use of the sclerotic coat? Of what is the choroid
coat chiefly composed? What is the use of this coat? How is it effected?
What is said of albinos? What care is taken in the manufacture of
optical instruments? 921. What is the use of the iris? When we look
toward the bottom of the eye, why does the pupil look like a black spot,
instead of an opening?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span></div>
<p>922. The cornea, and the aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous
humors, are transparent; so that rays of light traverse these
parts of the eye, and fall upon the retina. The office of
these humors and the cornea is to refract the rays of light in
such proportion as to direct the image in the most favorable
manner upon the retina.</p>
<p>923. The office of the retina is to receive the impression
of the rays of light which leave an object at which we look,
and it is upon it that a small but very clear image of that
object is formed. The impression thus produced by the reflected
light is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain,
which receives the sensation. This constitutes vision.</p>
<p>924. The optic nerve has but one function, that of sight.
Sensibility is conferred on this organ by a large branch from
the fifth pair of nerves, which ramifies upon the different
parts of the eye and its appendages. These parts, however,
receive some nervous filaments from the seventh pair.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The large number of sensitive nervous
filaments renders the visual organ very impressible to
bodies that cause irritation, as dust, or intense light. This
compels us to use due care to shield the eye from the influence
of agents that would impair or destroy vision.</p>
<p>2d. Although particles of dust, when in contact with the
delicate parts of the eye, induce severe pain, yet these parts
may be cut in surgical operations, and the patient&rsquo;s sufferings
are not as great as when an incision is made in the skin to
remove a small tumor.</p>
<p>925. Different degrees of density, as already mentioned,
modify the refractory power of any transparent medium. It
is found, on examination, that the cornea, the vitreous, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
crystalline, and the aqueous humors, have each, severally,
various degrees of density: and that the crystalline lens, at
its circumference, is less dense than at its centre. These
circumstances modify the direction of the refraction of the
rays of light, in their passage from the cornea to the retina.</p>
<p class='box'>922. What is the use of the cornea, aqueous, crystalline, and vitreous
humors? 923. What is the office of the retina? 924. What is the
function of the optic nerve? How is sensibility conferred on this organ?
Give the 1st observation in this connection. The 2d observation.</p>
<p>926. The refracting powers of the plane, convex, concave,
plano-convex, plano-concave, and concavo-convex lenses,<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a>
are different. The cornea and aqueous humors are convexo-concave,
the vitreous humor is concavo-convex, while the
crystalline humor is a convexo-convex medium. (Fig.&nbsp;139.)</p>

</div>
<p class='box'>925. Have the cornea and the humors of the eye different degrees of
density? What is said of the crystalline lens? What effect has the
different density of the parts of the eye upon the light admitted to this
organ? 926. What kind of lenses do the humors exhibit? 927. What
modifies the refracting powers of transparent mediums? How does this
principle apply to the humors of the eye?</p>
<p>927. The different degrees of convexity or concavity also
modify the refracting character of transparent mediums.
The crystalline lens is of different degrees of convexity on
its two sides. The convex surfaces of the aqueous and
vitreous humors are segments of circles, of different diameters
from their concave surfaces. (Fig.&nbsp;139.) All these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
circumstances still further influence the refracting character
of the visual organ. The achromatic arrangement of
the transparent refracting mediums of the eye, remedies
the aberration of refraction in the different portions of the
eye.</p>
<p>928. Again, the refracting power of lenses is modified by
their convexity or concavity. The more convex a lens is,
the shorter the distance from the refracting medium, where
the different refracted rays converge to a focus. To adapt
the eye to view objects at different distances, requires a
change in the refracting power of some of the transparent
mediums of the eye.</p>
<p>929. Both surfaces of the crystalline lens are oval, not
spherical, and the refraction of the rays of light is mainly
effected in this portion of the eye. Change the inclination
of this lens, so that different portions of its anterior surface
shall be directly behind the pupil, and its refracting power is
increased or diminished, as the surface presented is more or
less convex.</p>
<p>930. To view objects at a distance, a less convex lens is
needed than in examining articles very near the eye; and
this organ, from its structure, has the power of adaptation to
different distances. It is supposed that the muscular substance
of the ciliary body and processes changes, by its
contraction, the inclination of the crystalline lens. Without
this, or some other adapting power, a picture of objects
at different distances would not be formed upon the retina,
and the vision of every person would be defective, except
in reference to objects at certain definite distances from
the eye.</p>
<p class='box'>928. What modifies the refracting power of lenses? What is necessary
to adapt the eye to view objects at different distances? 929. Where is the
refraction of the rays of light mainly effected? 930. When we view
objects at a distance, what kind of lens is required? Has the eye the
power of adapting itself to different distances? How is it effected?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> It is well known that a separate image is
formed on each eye, and, if they are not in the same direction,
the objects will appear double. This is proved by
pressing one eye, so that the rays of light cannot enter it in
the same direction as they do in the other; consequently, the
vision is double.</p>
<p>931. By the action of the muscles of the eye, it is turned
in different directions, so that objects can be examined upon
each side, as well as in front, without turning the body. By
the slight or intense action of the straight muscles, the eye is
more or less compressed, and the form of the globe is
changed, together with the relative positions of the different
humors. This modification also adapts the eye to view objects
at different distances.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> If the eye is fixed for a time on some object
which is distinguished with difficulty, there is a painful sensation,
similar to that experienced by other muscles of the body
when used too long. This is called &ldquo;straining the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>932. When the refraction of the rays of light is too great,
as in over-convexity of the cornea, or the crystalline lens, or
the vitreous humor, or all of them, the image is formed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
little in front of the retina. Persons thus affected cannot see
distinctly, except at a very short distance. This infirmity
is called <i>near</i>, or <i>short-sightedness</i>. This defect is in a great
measure obviated by the use of concave glasses, which scatter
the luminous rays, and thus counterbalance the too strong
refracting force of the eye.</p>
<p class='box'>What does fig.&nbsp;143 represent? 931. Why can we see objects at the side
as well as in front of the eye, without turning the body? What is the
effect when the eye is fixed on an object that is indistinctly seen?</p>
<p>933. When the different parts of the eye are not sufficiently
convex, the image is formed beyond the retina, and thus
only distant objects are distinctly seen. This defect is called
<i>long-sightedness</i>. The feebleness in the refracting power of
the eye may be caused by disease; but usually it is a consequence
of old age, and is remedied by wearing spectacles
with convex glasses.</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE ORGANS OF VISION.</h3>
</div>
<p>934. <i>The eye, like other organs of the body, should be
used, and then rested.</i> If we look intently at an object for
a long time, the eye becomes wearied, and the power of
vision diminished. The observance of this rule is particularly
needful to those whose eyes are weak, and predisposed to
inflammation. On the contrary, if the eye is not called into
action, its functions are enfeebled.</p>
<p>935. <i>Sudden transitions of light should be avoided.</i> The
iris enlarges or contracts, as the light that falls upon the eye
is faint or strong; but the change is not instantaneous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
Hence the imperfect vision in passing from a strong to a dim
light, and the overwhelming sensation experienced on emerging
from a dimly-lighted apartment to one brilliantly illuminated.
A common cause of <i>am-aur-o&acute;sis</i>, or paralysis of
the retina, is, using the eye for a long time in a very intense
light.</p>
<p class='box'>932. What is short-sightedness? How is the defect remedied? 933. What
is long-sightedness? How is the defect remedied? 934&ndash;942. <i>Give the
hygiene of the organs of vision.</i> 934. Do the same principles apply to the
use of the eye as to other organs? What is the effect if the eye is fixed
intently on an object for a long time? What results if the eye is not
called into action? 935. Why should sudden transitions of light be
avoided?</p>
<p class='note'><i>Note.</i> Let the anatomy and physiology of the eye be reviewed from
figs. 139 and 143, or from anatomical outline plate No.&nbsp;10.</p>
<p>936. <i>Long-continued oblique positions of the eye should be
avoided, when viewing objects.</i> If the eye is turned obliquely
for a long time in viewing objects, it may produce an unnatural
contraction of the muscle called into action. This contraction
of the muscle is termed <i>stra-bis&acute;mus</i>, or cross-eye.
The practice of imitating the appearance of a person thus
affected, is injudicious, as the imitation, designed to be temporary,
may become permanent.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The vision of a &ldquo;cross-eye&rdquo; is always
defective. In general, only one eye is called into action, in
viewing the object to which the mind is directed. This
defect can be remedied by a surgical operation, which also
corrects the position of the eye.</p>
<p>937. <i>Children should be trained to use the eye upon objects
at different distances.</i> This is necessary, in order that the
vision may be correct when objects at various distances are
viewed. Any action unnatural to the muscles, if frequently
repeated, may and will modify the character and action of
the parts so operated upon. If a limb, as the arm, be kept
flexed for a long time, one set of muscles will be relaxed and
elongated, and another will be shortened, and its contractile
power will be increased. The same principle is true of
the eye.</p>
<p class='box'>What causes palsy of the retina? 936. Why should we avoid oblique
positions of the eye in viewing objects? What is said of the practice of
imitating persons thus affected? What is said in reference to the vision
of a &ldquo;cross-eye&rdquo;? 937. Why should children be trained to use the eye
upon objects at different distances? What is the effect if an unnatural
action of the muscles is frequently repeated? Does the same principle
apply to the eye?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span></div>
<p>938. In viewing objects very near the eye, the ciliary
processes are called into action to produce a proper inclination
of the crystalline lens, so that the rays of light may be
properly refracted to form a perfect image on the retina. In
looking at objects at a great distance, the ciliary processes
are called into a different action, to produce a different inclination
of the lens. Let either of these actions be repeated,
again and again, for weeks and months, and they will become
natural, and the acquired inclination will be permanent.</p>
<p>939. From the preceding principle, a person becomes
short or long sighted, as the objects to which the eye is usually
directed are near or remote. This is one reason why scholars,
watchmakers, and artisans, who bring minute objects near the
eye to examine them, are short-sighted, and why hunters and
sailors, who are habituated to view objects at a distance, are
long-sighted.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> In the management of children, whether in
the nursery or school-room, it is very important that their
books, or articles upon which they may labor, should be held
at an appropriate distance from the eye. Were this attended
to by the parent or instructor, we should not see so many
persons with defective vision.</p>
<p>940. Cleanliness, as well as the health of the eye, require
that it be bathed every morning with pure water, either cold
or tepid, accompanied with as little rubbing or friction as
possible. In all instances, the secretion from the lachrymal
glands, that sometimes collects at the angle of the eye, should
be removed, as it contains saline matter.</p>
<p>941. When small particles, or dust, get upon the eye, they
produce much inconvenience, which is often increased by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
harsh attempts to remove them. The individual should be
placed before a strong light, the lids held open with one
hand, or by another person, and the particles removed with
the corner of a fine linen or silk handkerchief.</p>
<p class='box'>938. What is the effect of repeatedly using the eye in one direction?
939. Why are artisans and scholars generally short-sighted? Why are
sailors and hunters long-sighted? How can defective vision in a great
degree be prevented? 940. What reasons are there for bathing the eye?
941. How can dust and other small particles be removed from the eye?</p>
<p>942. Sometimes the substance is concealed under the
upper eyelid, and it may then be exposed by turning back
the lid in the following manner: Take a knitting-needle, or
small, slender piece of stick, which is perfectly smooth, and
place it over the upper lid, in contact with, and just under
the edge of the orbit; then, holding it firmly, seize the eyelashes
with the fingers of the disengaged hand, and gently
turn the lid back over the stick or needle. The inner side
of the lid can then be examined, and any substance removed
that may have been there concealed. Too many trials ought
not to be made, if unsuccessful, as much inflammation may
be induced; but a surgeon should be consulted as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> Eyestones ought never to be placed in the
eye, as they often cause more pain and irritation than the evil
which they are intended to remedy.</p>
<p class='box'>942. How removed from the upper eyelid? Why should not eyestones
be used?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
<h3>THE SENSE OF HEARING.</h3>
</div>
<p>943. <span class='smcap'>The</span> sense of hearing is next in importance to that
of vision. Through this sense we are enabled to perceive
sounds, that not only subserve to our comfort and pleasure,
but are instrumental in promoting our intellectual enjoyments.
The organ of hearing, or the ear, is one of the most complicated
in the human body.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF HEARING.</h3>
</div>
<p>944. The <span class='smcaplc'>EAR</span> is composed of three parts: 1st. The <i>External
Ear.</i> 2d. The <i>Tym&acute;pan-um</i>, or middle ear. 3d. The
<i>La&acute;by-rinth</i>, or internal ear.</p>
<p>945. The <span class='smcaplc'>EXTERNAL EAR</span> is composed of two parts: The
<i>Pin&acute;na</i>, (pavilion of the ear,) and the <i>Me-a&acute;tus Aud-it-o&acute;ri-us
Ex-ter&acute;nus</i>, (auditory canal.)</p>
<p>946. The <span class='smcaplc'>PINNA</span> is a cartilaginous plate which surrounds
the entrance of the auditory canal. It presents many ridges
and furrows, arising from the folds of the cartilage that
form it.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> The pinna, in many animals, is movable;
in those that pursue their prey, it is generally directed forward;
in timid animals, as the hare and rabbit, it is directed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
backward. In man, this part is but slightly under the control
of the will.</p>
<p class='box'>943. What is said of the importance of hearing? Is the ear complicated
in its structure? 944&ndash;962. <i>Give the anatomy of the organs of hearing.</i>
944. Of how many parts is the ear composed? Name them. 945. Give the
parts of the external ear. 946. Describe the pinna. What is said in reference
to the pinna of many animals?</p>
<p>947. The <span class='smcaplc'>MEATUS AUDITORIUS</span> is a canal partly cartilaginous,
and partly bony, about an inch in length, which extends
inward from the pinna to the <i>Mem&acute;bra-na Tym&acute;pan-i</i>, (drum of
the ear.) It is narrower in the middle than at the extremities.
It is lined by an extremely thin pouch of cuticle, which, when
withdrawn, after maceration, preserves the form of the canal.
Some stiff, short hairs are also found in the interior of the
channel, which stretch across the tube, and prevent the ingress
of insects. Beneath the cuticle are a number of small follicles,
which secrete the wax of the ear.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>948. The <span class='smcaplc'>MEMBRANA TYMPANI</span> is a thin, semi-transparent
membrane, of an oval shape. It is about three eighths of an
inch in diameter, and is inserted into a groove around the
circumference of the meatus, near its termination. This
membrane is placed obliquely across the area of that tube.
It is concave toward the meatus, and convex toward the
tympanum.</p>
<p>949. The <span class='smcaplc'>TYMPANUM</span> consists of an irregular bony cavity,
situated within the temporal bone. It is bounded externally
by the membrana tympani; internally by its inner wall; and
in its circumference by the petrous portion of the temporal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
bone and mastoid cells. The tympanum contains four small
bones, called the <i>os-sic&acute;u-la au-di&acute;tus</i>. These are named separately,
the <i>mal&acute;le-us</i>, <i>in&acute;cus</i>, <i>sta&acute;pes</i>, and <i>or-bic&acute;u-lar</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>954. The <span class='smcaplc'>EUSTACHIAN TUBE</span> is a canal of communication,
extending obliquely between the pharynx and the anterior
circumference of the tympanum. In structure it is partly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
fibro-cartilaginous and partly bony. It is broad and expanded
at its pharyngeal extremity, and narrow and compressed at
the tympanum.</p>
<p class='box'>953. Where are the mastoid cells? Explain fig.&nbsp;146. 954. Describe the

<p>955. The small openings of the middle ear are for the
entrance and exit of the chorda tympani, (a small nerve that
crosses the tympanum,) and for the exit of the muscles
that act upon the membrana tympani and bones of the ear.</p>
<p>956. The <span class='smcaplc'>LABYRINTH</span> consists of a membranous and a bony
portion. The bony labyrinth presents a series of cavities
which are channelled through the substance of the petrous
bone. It is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and
the <i>Aud&acute;it-o-ry Nerve</i>. The labyrinth is divided into the
<i>Ves&acute;ti-bule</i>, <i>Sem-i-cir&acute;cu-lar Canals</i>, and <i>Coch&acute;le-a</i>.</p>
<p>957. The <span class='smcaplc'>VESTIBULE</span> is a small, three-cornered cavity,
situated immediately within the inner wall of the tympanum.</p>
<p>958. The <span class='smcaplc'>SEMICIRCULAR CANALS</span> are three bony passages
which communicate with the vestibule, into which two of them
open at both extremities, and the third at one extremity.</p>
<p>959. The <span class='smcaplc'>COCHLEA</span> forms the anterior portion of the labyrinth.
It consists of a bony and gradually tapering canal,
about one and a half inches in length, which makes two turns
and a half, spirally, around a central axis, called the <i>mo-di&acute;o-lus</i>.
The modiolus is large near its base, where it corresponds
with the first turn of the cochlea, and diminishes in diameter
toward its extremity.</p>
<p>960. The interior of the canal of the cochlea is partially
divided into two passages, by means of a bony and membranous
plate. At the extremity of the modiolus, the two passages
communicate with each other. At the other extremity,
one opens into the vestibule; the other into the tympanum, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
the foramen rotundum. The internal surface of the bony
labyrinth is lined by a fibro-serous membrane.</p>

<p>961. The membranous labyrinth is smaller in size, but a
perfect counterpart, with respect to form, of the bony vestibule,
cochlea, and semicircular canals. Within this labyrinth are
two small, elongated sacs, which are filled with a fluid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
<h3>PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ORGANS OF HEARING.</h3>
</div>
<p>963. <span class='smcap'>Hearing</span> is that function by which we obtain a knowledge
of the vibratory motions of bodies, which constitute sounds.
The precise function of all the different parts of the ear is not
known.</p>
<p>964. The function of that part of the external ear which
projects from the head is to collect sounds and reflect them
into the meatus.</p>
<p>965. The membrana tympani serves to facilitate the transmission
of sounds, and also to moderate their intensity. It is
so arranged that it can be relaxed or tightened.</p>
<p><i>Observation.</i> This membrane, when healthy, has no opening;
and it must be apparent that the apprehension which is
often expressed, that insects will penetrate further, is groundless.
The pain is owing to the extreme sensibility of the
membrana tympani.</p>
<p>966. The supposed office of the tympanum is to transmit
the vibrations made on the membrana tympani to the internal
ear. This is effected by the air which it contains, and by the
chain of small bones that are enclosed in this cavity.</p>
<p>967. The use of the Eustachian tube is to admit air into
the tympanum, which renders the pressure on both sides equal,
and thus its membrane is kept in a proper state of tension.</p>
<p class='box'>963&ndash;971. <i>Give the physiology of the organs of hearing.</i> 963. What is
hearing? Are the precise functions of the different parts of the ear known?
964. What is the function of the external ear? 965. Of the membrana
tympani? What observation in reference to this membrane? 966. What is
the supposed office of the middle ear? 967. What is the use of the Eustachian
tube?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span></div>
<p><i>Observation.</i> When near a cannon, or a field-piece, about
being discharged, by opening the mouth the impression upon
the auditory nerve will be diminished, and the unpleasant sensation
lessened. This is the result of the air in the middle ear
escaping through the <a name='TC_126'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Eustuchian'">Eustachian</ins> tube, when the vibrations of
the membrana tympani are violent.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>968. But little is known of the functions of the internal
ear; its parts are filled with a watery fluid, in which the filaments
of the auditory nerve terminate.</p>
<p class='box'>What observation in this connection? 968. What is the function of the
internal ear?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span></div>
<p>969. Many of the parts just enumerated aid in hearing, but
are not absolutely essential to this <a name='TC_127'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">sense.</ins> But if the vestibule
and auditory nerve are diseased or destroyed, no sound is then
perceived. If this sense is destroyed in early life, the person
also loses the power of articulating words. Hence a man
born deaf is always dumb.</p>
<p>970. The transmission of sound through the different parts
of the ear will now be explained by aid of fig.&nbsp;148. The
vibrations of air are collected by the external ear, and conducted
through the tube (1) to the membrana tympani, (2.)
From the membrane vibrations pass along the chain of bones,
(3, 4, 5.) The bone 5 communicates with the internal ear,
(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12.) From the internal ear
the impression is transmitted to the brain by the nerve, (13.)</p>
<p>971. The auditory nerve, like the optic, has but one function,
that of special sensibility. The nerves which furnish
the ear with ordinary sensibility, proceed from the fifth pair.</p>

<h3>HYGIENE OF THE ORGANS OF HEARING.</h3>
</div>
<p>972. <span class='smcap'>Hearing</span>, like the other senses, is capable of very
great improvement. By cultivation, the blind are enabled to
judge with great accuracy the distance of bodies in motion,
and even the height of buildings. It is also capable of improvement
when all the other senses are perfect. Thus the
Indian will distinguish sounds that are inaudible to the white
man.</p>
<p class='box'>969. What parts of the ear are essential in order to hear sounds?
What follows loss of hearing? 971. What is the office of the auditory
nerve? What nerves convey ordinary sensibility to the ear? 972&ndash;978.
<i>Give the hygiene of the organs of hearing.</i> 972. Is this sense capable
of improvement? How does this sense aid the blind? Is it also capable
of improvement when all the other senses are perfect? In whom is this
illustrated?</p>
<p class='note'><i>Note.</i> Let the anatomy and physiology of the organs of hearing be
reviewed, from fig.&nbsp;148, or from anatomical outline plate No. <a name='TC_128'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">10.</ins></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span></div>
<p>973. Acute hearing requires perfection in the structure and
functions of the different parts of the ear, and that portion of
the brain from which the auditory nerve proceeds. Deafness
is by no means unfrequent. We will now advert to some of
the common causes of imperfect hearing.</p>
<p>974. The structure or functional action of the brain may
be deranged by inflammation, by compression, or by debility,
and produce deafness. The first is seen during inflammatory
affections of the brain, and in fevers; the second is seen in
accidental injuries of the head; the third is seen in old age,
and after severe diseases of the head, and fevers. In these
cases, applications to, and operations upon, the ear do no good.
The only remedy is to remove, if possible, the diseased condition
of the brain.</p>
<p>975. Imperfect hearing may be produced by the destruction
of the membrana tympani, or removal of the bones of the
ear, or the parts within the labyrinth. In these instances,
medical treatment is of no avail, as the destroyed parts cannot
be restored.</p>
<p>976. Hearing may be rendered defective by a diminution of
the vibratory character of the membrana tympani. This may
result from a thickening of this membrane, or from an accumulation
of wax upon its outer surface. The increased
thickness is usually the result of inflammation, either acute
or chronic. The proper treatment is such as is efficient to
remove inflammatory action.</p>
<p><i>Observations.</i> 1st. The introduction of heads of pins into
the ear is a frequent cause of chronic inflammation of the
membrana tympani. Hence this practice should never be
adopted, and if acquired, should be abandoned.</p>
<p class='box'>973. On what does acute hearing depend? 974. State effects on the
hearing in some conditions of the brain. How relieved? 975. Of the
effect on hearing when the bones of the ear or the labyrinth are destroyed?
Is medical treatment of any avail? 976. What conditions of the drum of
the ear may impair hearing? How relieved? What is said of the introduction
of pins to cleanse the ear?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span></div>
<p>2d. The accumulations of viscid wax may be softened by
dropping some animal oil into the ear, and then removing it by
ejecting warm soap suds a few hours subsequent to the use of
the oil. This may be repeated for several successive days.</p>
<p>977. Hearing may be impaired by obstruction of the Eustachian
tube. The closure of this canal diminishes the vibratory
character of the air within the tympanum, in the same
manner as closing the opening in the side of a drum. For
the same reason, enlarged tonsils, inflammation and ulceration
of the fauces and nasal passages during and subsequent to an
attack of scarlet fever, and the inflammation attending the
&ldquo;sore throat&rdquo; in colds, are common causes of this obstruction.</p>
<p>978. The treatment of such cases of defective hearing, is
to have the tonsils, if enlarged, removed by a surgeon; for
the inflammation and thickening of the parts remedial means
should be applied, directed by a skilful physician. The nostrums
for the cure of deafness are generally of an oleaginous
character, and may be beneficial in cases of defective hearing
caused by an accumulation of wax upon the drum of the ear,
but in this respect they are no better than the ordinary animal
oils.</p>
<p class='box'>What is the remedy where there is an accumulation of wax? 977. What
is the effect on hearing if the Eustachian tube is obstructed? 978. What
is the treatment when deafness is caused by inflammation or ulceration
the fauces? What is said of the nostrums used for deafness?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>
<h3>MEANS OF PRESERVING THE HEALTH.<a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a></h3>
</div>
<p>979. <span class='smcap'>Our</span> bodies are constituted in harmony with certain
laws, and every person should learn these, in order to regulate
his actions and the performance of his duties, so that
health may be unimpaired, and the power of enjoyment,
activity, and usefulness continue while life lasts.</p>
<p>980. It is a law of the bones and the muscles, that they
should either be used in some vocation, or called into action
by some social play and active sport.</p>
<p>981. All admit that food is necessary to sustain life; and
unless it be of a proper quality, taken in proper quantities, and
at proper times, the functions of the digestive organs will be
deranged, and disease produced.</p>
<p>982. Pure air is essential to the full enjoyment of health.
The impure air of unventilated rooms may be breathed, and
the effect be so gradual as not to arrest attention; yet it is
a violation of the physical laws, and, sooner or later, we pay
the penalty in disease and suffering.</p>
<p class='box'>979. Why is it incumbent on every person to learn the laws of health?
980. Give a law of the muscles. 981. In preserving the health, is it necessary
to give attention to the food which is eaten? Why? 982. What
beside food is essential to the full enjoyment of health? What is said of
the impure air of unventilated rooms? 983. What should be observed in
regard to sleep?</p>
<p>983. The body also requires sleep; and if it is not taken
at the right time, or with regularity, we do not feel full refreshment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
from &ldquo;tired nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer.&rdquo; Let youth be
taught that &ldquo;early to bed and early to rise&rdquo; gives him health
and its attendant blessings. The brain, like other organs of
the body, should be called into action at proper times.</p>
<p>984. From the extent of the surface of the skin, and the
close sympathy that exists between it and those organs whose
office is, to remove the waste particles of matter from the
body, it therefore becomes very important in the preservation
of the health, that the functions of this membrane be properly
maintained.</p>
<p>985. The function of the circulatory and secretory organs,
together with the operations of absorption and nutrition, should
be steadily maintained, as vitality and the generation of animal
heat are intimately connected with these processes. In
the proper performance of these functions, very much depends
on the observance of the laws of the muscular, digestive
respiratory, dermoid, and nervous apparatuses.</p>
<p>REMOVAL OF DISEASE.</p>
<p>986. It is seldom that a physician is called in the first
stages of disease. At this important period, the treatment
adopted should be proper and judicious, or the sufferings of
the patient are increased, and life, to a greater or less degree,
is jeopardized. Hence the utility of knowing what <i>should be
done</i>, and what <i>should not be done</i>, in order that the health
may be rapidly regained.</p>
<p>987. In all instances of acute disease, it is proper to rest,
not only the body, but the mind. To effect this, the patient
should cease from physical exertion, and also withdraw his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_427' name='page_427'></a>427</span>
thoughts from study and business operations. This should be
done, even if the person is but slightly indisposed.</p>
<p class='box'>984. Why should the functions of the skin be properly maintained?
985. Show the necessity of maintaining properly other functions of the
system. 986. What is important in the first stages of disease? 987. What
is proper in all instances of acute disease? How can it be effected?</p>
<p>988. Select a room for a sick person that is exposed to as
little external noise as possible, as impressions made on the
organ of hearing greatly influence the nervous system. Likewise
select a spacious, well-ventilated apartment, that has no
superfluous furniture. The practice of placing a sick person
in a small, ill-arranged sleeping-room, when a more spacious
room can be used, is poor economy, not to say unkind.</p>
<p>989. Care is necessary in regulating the light of a sick-room.
While a strong light would produce an increased
action of the vessels of the brain, a moderate light would be
an appropriate stimulus to this organ. It is seldom or never
necessary to exclude all light from the sick-chamber.</p>
<p>990. A sick person, whether a child or an adult, should not
be disturbed by visitors, even if their calls are short. The
excitement of meeting them is followed by a depression of the
nervous system. The more dangerous and apparently nearer
death the sick person is, the more rigorous should be the
observance of this suggestion. Nor should the sick-room be
opened to privileged classes; for the excitement caused by a
visit from relations and the virtuous, will do as much injury to
the sick, as that produced by strangers and the vicious.</p>
<p>991. The custom of visiting and conversing with sick friends
during the intervals of daily labor, and particularly on <i>Sunday</i>,
is a great evil. No person will thus intrude herself in the sick-chamber
who cares more for the welfare of the suffering friend
than for the gratification of a <i>sympathetic curiosity</i>. Inquiries
can be made of the family respecting the sick, and complimentary
or necessary messages can be communicated through
the nurse.</p>
<p class='box'>988. What rooms should be selected for the sick? Why? 989. What
is said in reference to the quantity of light admitted into a sick-room?
990. What effect have calls on the sick? 991. What is said of the custom
of calling and conversing with the sick during the intervals of daily labor?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span></div>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> While attending a Miss B., of N. H., sick of
fever, I pronounced her better, withdrew medicine, directed a
simple, low diet, and the exclusion of all visitors. In the
evening I was sent for to attend her. There was a violent
relapse into the disease, which continued to increase in severity
until the fourth day, when death terminated her sufferings.
I learned that, soon after I gave directions that no visitors
be admitted into her room, several <i>particular</i> friends were permitted
to enter the chamber and talk with the sick girl. Their
conversation produced a severe headache; and, to use the
language of the patient, &ldquo;it seemed as if their talk would
kill me;&rdquo; and <i>it did kill her</i>.</p>
<p>992. No <i>solid food</i> should be taken in the first stages of
disease, even if the affection is slight. The thirst can be
allayed by drinking cold water, barley-water, and other preparations
of an unstimulating character. It is wrong to tempt
the appetite of a person who is indisposed. The cessation
of a desire for food, is the warning of nature, that the system
is in such a state that it cannot be digested.</p>
<p>993. When a patient is recovering from illness, the food
should be simple, and in quantities not so great as to oppress
the stomach. It should also be given with regularity. &ldquo;Eat
little and often,&rdquo; with no regard to regularity, is a pernicious
practice.</p>
<p>994. When a physician attends a sick person, he should
have the <i>special</i> management of the food, particularly after
the medicine has been withdrawn and the patient is convalescent.
The prevailing idea that <i>every</i> person may safely advise
relative to food, or that the appetite of the convalescing person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
is a competent guide, is dangerous; and cannot be too
much censured.</p>
<p class='box'>Give an illustration. 992. What suggestion relative to food in the first
stages of disease? How can the thirst be allayed? 993. When the
patient is convalescent, how should the food be given? What is said of
the practice of eating &ldquo;little and often&rdquo;? 994. Who should have the
special management of food when medicine is withdrawn? What idea
prevails in the community?</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> In 1832, I attended a Miss M., sick of fever.
After an illness of a few days, the fever abated, and I directed
a simple, unstimulating diet. Business called me from
the town two days. During my absence, a sympathizing,
officious matron called; found her weak, but improving; and
told her she needed food to strengthen her; and that &ldquo;it
would now do her good.&rdquo; Accordingly, eggs and a piece of
beefsteak were prepared, and given to the convalescent girl.
She ate heartily, and the result was a relapse into a fever
more violent than the first attack.</p>
<p>995. It is very important in disease that <i>the skin be kept
clean</i>. A free action of the vessels of this part of the body
exerts a great influence in removing disease from the internal
organs, as well as keeping them in health. If the twenty or
thirty ounces of waste, hurtful matter, that passes through the
&ldquo;pores&rdquo; of the skin in twenty-four hours, are not removed by
frequent bathing and dry rubbing, it deranges the action of
the vessels that separate this waste matter from the blood, and
thus increases the disease of the internal organs.</p>
<p><i>Illustration.</i> Mrs. M. R., of N., Mass., was afflicted with
disease of the lungs and cough. This was accompanied with
a dry, inactive condition of the skin. As medicine had no
salutary effect in relieving her cough, she was induced by the
advice of the clergyman of the parish to enter upon a systematic
course of bathing twice every day. Soon the skin became
soft, its proper functions were restored, the disease of the
lungs yielded, and the cough disappeared.</p>
<p>996. Every sick person should breathe <i>pure air</i>. The
purer the blood that courses through the body, the greater the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
energy of the system to remove disease. The confined
vitiated air of the sick-chamber, not unfrequently prolongs disease;
and in many instances, the affection is not only aggravated,
but, even rendered fatal, by its injurious influences.</p>
<p class='box'>Give an illustration of the evil effects attending such an idea. 995. Does
the skin exert a great influence in removing disease from the internal
organs, as well as in keeping them in health? Give an illustration
996. Why should every sick person, particularly, breathe pure air?</p>
<p><i>Illustrations.</i> 1st. In 1833, I was called, in consultation
with another physician, to Mr. H., who was much debilitated,
and delirious. For several successive days he had not slept.
His room was kept very warm and close, for fear he would
&ldquo;take cold.&rdquo; The only change that I made in the treatment,
was to open the door and window, at a distance from the bed.
In a short time, the delirium ceased, and he fell into a quiet
slumber. From this time he rapidly recovered, and the delirium
was probably the result of breathing impure air.</p>
<p>2d. Formerly, every precaution was used to prevent persons
sick of the small-pox from breathing fresh air. When
Mrs. Ramsay had this disease in Charleston, S.C., her friends,
supposing that life was extinct, caused her body to be removed
from the house to an open shed. The pure air revived the
vital spark. The result probably would have been different, had
she been kept a few hours longer in the vitiated air.</p>
<p>997. The influence of habit should not be disregarded in
the removal of disease. If food or drink is to be administered,
however small in quantity or simple its quality, it should be
given at or about the time when the ordinary meals were
taken in health.</p>
<p>998. Again, the usual time when the patient was in the
habit of retiring for sleep should be observed, and all preparation
necessary for the sick-room during the night should be
made previous to this hour. Efforts should also be made to
evacuate the waste matter of the digestive and urinary organs
at the period which habit has formed in health. This is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
only a remedial agent in disease, but often precludes the
necessity of laxative or drastic cathartics.</p>
<p class='box'>Are not diseases prolonged, and even rendered fatal, from breathing the
impure, vitiated air of the sick-chamber? Give illustration 1st. Give
illustration 2d. 997. What is said respecting the influence of habit in
removing disease?</p>
<p>999. <span class='smcap'>Medicine</span> is sometimes necessary to <i>assist</i> the natural
powers of the system to remove disease; but it is only
an <i>assistant</i>. While emetics are occasionally useful in removing
food and other articles from the stomach that would cause
disease if suffered to remain, and cathartics are valuable, in
some instances, to relieve the alimentary canal of irritating
residuum, yet the frequent administration of either will cause
serious disease.</p>
<p>1000. Although medicine is useful in some instances, yet,
in a great proportion of the cases of disease, including fevers
and inflammations of all kinds, attention to the laws of health
will tend to relieve the system from disease; more certainly
and speedily, and with less danger, than when medicines are
administered.</p>
<p>1001. Thomas Jefferson, in writing to Dr. Wistar, of Philadelphia,
said, &ldquo;I would have the physician learn the limit
of his art.&rdquo; I would say, Have the matrons, and those who
are continually advising &ldquo;herb teas,&rdquo; and other &ldquo;cure-alls,&rdquo;
for any complaint, labelled with some popular name, learn
the limits of their duty, namely, attention to the laws of
health. The rule of every family, and each individual, should
be, to touch not, taste not of medicine of <i>any kind</i>, except
when directed by a well-educated and honest physician, (sudden
disease from accidents excepted.)</p>
<p class='box'>999. What is said of the use of medicine? 1000. Of its use in fevers
and many other cases of disease? 1001. What remark by Thomas Jefferson
to Dr. Wistar? What should matrons learn? What should be the
rule of every person in regard to taking medicine? What exception?</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XLIX_DIRECTIONS_FOR_NURSES' id='CHAPTER_XLIX_DIRECTIONS_FOR_NURSES'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>
<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR NURSES.</h3>
</div>
<p>1002. <span class='smcap'>The</span> nurse requires knowledge and practice to
enable her to discharge aright her duty to the patient, as
much as the physician and surgeon do to perform what is
incumbent on them. Woman, from her constitution and
habits, is the natural nurse of the sick; and, in general, no
small portion of her time is spent in ministering at the
couch of disease and suffering.</p>
<p>1003. As the young and vigorous, as well as the aged and
the infirm, are liable to be laid upon the bed of sickness, by an
epidemic, or imprudent exposure, or by some accident, it is
therefore necessary that the girl, as well as the matron, may
know how she can render services in an efficient and proper
manner. No <i>girl</i> should consider her education complete
who is not acquainted with the principles of the duties of a
general nurse and a temporary watcher.</p>
<p>1004. It is to be regretted, that while we have medical
schools and colleges to educate physicians, there is no institution
to educate <i>nurses</i> in their equally responsible station. In
the absence of such institutions, the defect can be remedied,
to some extent, by teaching every girl <i>hygiene</i>, or <i>the laws of
health</i>. To make such knowledge more available and complete,
attention is invited to the following suggestions relative
to the practical duties of a nurse.</p>
<p class='box'>1002. Does the nurse require knowledge and practice in her employment,
as well as the physician? Who is the natural nurse of the sick?
1003. What, then, is incumbent on every girl? 1004. Should there be
schools to educate nurses, as well as physicians and surgeons?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span></div>
<p>1005. <span class='smcap'>Bathing.</span> The nurse, before commencing to bathe
the patient, should provide herself with water, two towels, a
sponge, a piece of soft flannel, and a sheet. The temperature
of the room should also be observed.</p>
<p>1006. When the patient is feeble, use <i>tepid</i> or warm
water. Cold water should only be used when the system has
vigor enough to produce reaction upon the skin. This is
shown by the increased redness of the skin, and a feeling of
warmth and comfort, after a proper amount of friction.
Before using the sponge to bathe, a sheet, or fold of cloth,
should be spread smoothly over the bed, and under the patient,
to prevent the bed-linen on which the patient lies from becoming
damp or wet.</p>
<p>1007. Apply the wet sponge to one part of the body at a
time; as the arm, for instance. By doing so, the liability of
contracting chills is diminished. Take a dry, soft towel, wipe
the bathed part, and follow this by vigorous rubbing with a
crash towel, or, what is better, a mitten made of this material;
then use briskly a piece of soft flannel, to remove all moisture
that may exist on the skin, and particularly between the fingers
and the flections of the joints. In this manner bathe the entire
body.</p>
<p>1008. The sick should be thoroughly bathed, at least twice
in twenty-four hours. Particular attention should be given
to the parts between the fingers and toes, and about the
flections of the joints, as the accumulation of the excretions is
most abundant on these parts. In bathing, these portions of
the system are very generally neglected. The best time for
bathing, is when the patient feels most vigorous, and freest
from exhaustion. The practice of daubing the face and
hands with a towel dipped in hot rum, camphor, and vinegar,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
does not remove the impurities, but causes the skin soon to
feel dry, hard, and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class='box'>1005. What should a nurse provide herself with, before bathing a patient?
1006. When should cold water be used? 1007. How should the bathing
then be performed, so that the patient may not contract a cold? 1008. How
often should a sick person be bathed? What is said of daubing the face
and hands merely with a wet cloth?</p>
<p>1009. <span class='smcap'>Food.</span> It is the duty of every woman to know how
to make the simple preparations adapted to a low diet, in the
most wholesome and the most palatable way. Water-gruel,<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
which is the simplest of all preparations, is frequently so ill-made
as to cause the patient to loathe it. Always prepare the
food for the sick, in the neatest and most careful manner.</p>
<p>1010. When the physician enjoins abstinence from food,
the nurse should strictly obey the injunction. She should be
as particular to know the physician&rsquo;s directions about diet, as
in knowing how and when to give the prescribed medicines,
and obey them as implicitly.</p>
<p>1011. When a patient is convalescent, the desire for food
is generally strong, and it often requires firmness and patience,
together with great care, on the part of the nurse, that the
food is prepared suitably, and given at proper times The
physician should direct how frequently it should be taken.</p>
<p>1012. <span class='smcap'>Pure Air.</span> It is the duty of the nurse to see that
not only the room is well ventilated in the morning, but that
fresh air is constantly admitted during the day. Great care
must be taken, however, that the patient does not feel the
current.</p>
<p>1013. Bed-linen, as well as that of the body, should be aired
every day, and oftener changed in sickness than in health.
All clothing, when changed, should be well dried, and warmed
by a fire previous to its being put on the patient or the bed.</p>
<p class='box'>1009. Should every woman know how to make the simple preparations
adapted to a low diet? 1010. Should the nurse strictly obey the injunctions
of the physician relative to food? 1011. What period of a person&rsquo;s
illness requires the most care in regard to the food? 1012. Give another
duty of the nurse. 1013. What directions respecting the bed-linen of the
patient? What is necessary when there is a change of clothing?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span></div>
<p>1014. <span class='smcap'>Temperature.</span> The warmth of the chamber should
be carefully watched by the nurse. The feelings of the
patient or nurse are not to be relied on as an index of the
temperature of the room. There should be a well-adjusted
thermometer in every sick-room. This should be frequently
consulted by the nurse.</p>
<p>1015. The temperature of the sick-chamber should be
<i>moderate</i>. If it is so cold as to cause a chill, the disease will
be aggravated. If, on the other hand, it is too warm, the
patient is enfeebled and rendered more susceptible to cold on
leaving the sick-chamber. The Latin maxim, &ldquo;<i>In medio
tutissimus ibis</i>,&rdquo; (in medium there is most safety,) should be
regarded in the rooms of the sick.</p>
<p>1016. <span class='smcap'>Quiet</span>. The room of the patient should be kept free
from noise. The community should be guided by this rule,
that no more persons remain in the room of the sick, than the
welfare of the patient demands. It is the duty of the physician
to direct when visitors can be admitted or excluded from
the sick-room, and the nurse should see that these directions
are enforced.</p>
<p>1017. The movements of the attendants should be gentle and
noiseless. Shutting doors violently, creaking hinges, and all
unnecessary noise, should be avoided. Most persons refrain
from loud talking in the sick chamber, but are not equally
careful to abstain from <i>whispering</i>, which is often more trying
than a common tone.</p>
<p>1018. It is the duty of the nurse to ascertain the habits
of the patient as respects the period for eating and sleep,
when in health, that she may prepare the food and arrange
the sick-room in accordance with the practice of the patient.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span>
If the person who is sick is ignorant of the necessity of the
removal of the waste products from the system the nurse
should invite attention to these functions at such periods as
are in accordance with the previous habits of the patient.</p>
<p class='box'>1014. Why should there be a well-adjusted thermometer in every sick-chamber?
1015. What is said of the temperature of the sick-chamber?
1016. Why should the sick-room be kept quiet? 1017. What is said of
noise in the sick-chamber? Of whispering? 1018. Should the habits of
the patient be regarded in reference to the period for eating and sleep?</p>
<p>1019. The deportment and remarks of the nurse to the
patient should be tranquil and encouraging. The illness of a
friend, or persons who have recently died, should not be alluded
to in the sick-room. No doubts or fears of the patient&rsquo;s
recovery, either by a look or by a word, should be communicated
by the nurse in the chamber of the sick. When such
information is necessary to be communicated, it is the duty of
the physician to impart it to the sick person.</p>
<p>1020. The nurse should not confine herself to the sick-room
more than six hours at a time. She should eat her food
regularly, sleep at regular periods, and take exercise daily in
the open air. To do this, let her quietly leave the room when
the patient is sleeping. A watcher, or temporary nurse, may
supply her place. There is but little danger of contracting
disease, if the nurse attends to the simple laws of health, and
remains not more than six hours at a time in the sick-room.</p>
<div class='chsp'>
<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR WATCHERS.</h3>
</div>
<p>1021. These necessary assistants, like the nurse, should
have knowledge and practice. They should ever be cheerful,
kind, firm, and attentive in the presence of the patient.</p>
<p>1022. A simple, nutritious supper should be eaten before
entering the sick-room; and it is well, during the night, to
take some plain food.</p>
<p class='box'>1019. What should be the deportment of the nurse toward the patient?
Should doubts and fears of the patient&rsquo;s recovery be communicated in the
sick-room? When necessary to impart such intelligence, on whom does it
depend? 1020. How long should a nurse remain in the sick-chamber at a
time? 1021. What qualifications are necessary in a watcher? 1022. What
directions in regard to the food of the watcher?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span></div>
<p>1023. When watching in cold weather, a person should be
warmly dressed, and furnished with an extra garment, as a
cloak or shawl, because the system becomes exhausted toward
morning, and less heat is generated in the body.</p>
<p>1024. Light-colored clothing should be worn by those who
have care of the sick, in preference to dark-colored apparel;
particularly if the disease is of a contagious character. Experiments
have shown, that black and other dark colors will
absorb more readily the subtile effluvia that emanate from
sick persons, than white or light colors.</p>
<p>1025. Whatever may be wanted during the night, should
be brought into the sick-chamber, or the adjoining room, before
the family retires for sleep, in order that the slumbers of
the patient be not disturbed by haste, or searching for needed
articles.</p>
<p>1026. The same general directions should be observed by
watchers, as are given to the nurse; nor should the watcher
deem it necessary to make herself acceptable to the patient
by exhausting conversation.</p>
<p>1027. It can hardly be expected that the farmer, who has
been laboring hard in the field, or the mechanic, who has
toiled during the day, is qualified to render all those little
attentions that a sick person requires. Hence, would it not
be more benevolent and economical to employ and <i>pay</i> watchers,
who are qualified by knowledge and <i>training</i>, to perform
this duty in a faithful manner, while the kindness and sympathy
of friends may be <i>practically</i> manifested by assisting to
defray the expenses of these qualified and useful assistants?</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>
<h2>POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES</h2>
<p>1028. <span class='smcap'>Poisoning</span>, either from accident or design, is of such frequency
and danger, that it is of the greatest importance that every person should
know the proper mode of procedure in such cases, in order to render immediate
assistance when within his <a name='TC_129'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">power.</ins></p>
<p>1029. Poisons are divided into two classes&mdash;<i>mineral</i> (which include the
acids) and <i>vegetable</i>.</p>
<p>1030. The first thing, usually, to be done, when it is ascertained that a
poison has been swallowed, is to evacuate the stomach, unless vomiting
takes place spontaneously. Emetics of the sulphate of zinc, (white vitriol,)
or ipecacuanha, (ipecac,) or ground mustard seed, should be given.</p>
<p>1031. When vomiting has commenced, it should be aided by large and
frequent draughts of the following drinks: flaxseed tea, gum-water, slippery-elm
tea, barley water, sugar and water, or any thing of a mucilaginous
or diluent character.</p>
<h3>MINERAL POISONS.</h3>
<p>1032. <span class='smcap'>Ammonia.</span>&mdash;The <i>water of ammonia</i>, if taken in an over-dose, and
in an undiluted state, acts as a violent corrosive poison.</p>
<p>1033. The best and most effectual antidote is <i>vinegar</i>. It should be
administered in water, without delay. It neutralizes the ammonia, and
renders it inactive. Emetics should not be given.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1034. <span class='smcap'>Antimony.</span>&mdash;The <i>wine of antimony</i> and <i>tartar emetic</i>, if taken in
over-doses, cause distressing vomiting. In addition to the diluent, mucilaginous
drinks, give a tea-spoonful of the sirup of poppies, paregoric, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
twenty drops of laudanum, every twenty minutes, until five or six doses
have been taken, or the vomiting ceases.</p>
<p class='box'>1025. Is it useful to know the antidotes or remedies for poison? 1029. Into how
many classes are poisons divided? 1030. What is the first thing to be done when it is
ascertained that poison has been swallowed? 1031. What should be taken after
the vomiting has commenced? 1032. What effect has an over-dose of ammonia?
1033. The antidote? Should an emetic be given for this poison? 1034. What effect
has an over-dose of the wine of antimony or tartar emetic?</p>
<p>1035. The antidotes are <i>nutgalls</i> and <i>oak bark</i>, which may be administered
in infusion, or by steeping in water.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1036. <span class='smcap'>Arsenic</span>.&mdash;When this has been taken, administer an emetic of
ipecac, speedily, in mucilaginous teas, and use the stomach-pump as soon
as possible.</p>
<p>1037. The antidote is the <i>hydrated peroxide of iron</i>. It should be kept
constantly on hand at the apothecaries&rsquo; shops. It may be given in any
quantity, without injurious results.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1038. <span class='smcap'>Copper</span>.&mdash;The most common cause of poisoning from this metal,
is through the careless use of cooking utensils made of it, on which the
<i>acetate of copper</i> (verdigris) has been allowed to form. When this has been
taken, immediately induce vomiting, give mucilaginous drinks, or the
<i>white of eggs</i>, diffused in water.</p>
<p>1039. The antidote is the <i>carbonate of soda</i>, which should be administered
without delay.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1040. <span class='smcap'>Lead</span>.&mdash;The <i>acetate</i> (sugar) <i>of lead</i> is the preparation of this metal,
which is liable to be taken accidentally, in poisonous doses. Induce immediate
vomiting, by emetics of ground mustard seed, sulphate of zinc, and
diluent drinks.</p>
<p>1041. The antidote is diluted <i>sulphuric acid</i>. When this acid is not to be
obtained, either the sulphate of magnesia, (epsom salts,) or the sulphate of
soda, (glauber&rsquo;s salts,) will answer every purpose.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1042. <span class='smcap'>Mercury</span>.&mdash;The preparation of this mineral by which poisoning
is commonly produced, is <i>corrosive sublimate</i>. The mode of treatment to
be pursued when this poison has been swallowed, is as follows: The <i>whites
of a dozen eggs</i> should be beaten in two quarts of cold water, and a tumbler-full
given every two minutes, to induce vomiting. When the whites of
eggs are not to be obtained, soap and water should be mixed with wheat
flour, and given in copious draughts, and the stomach-pump introduced
as soon as possible. Emetics or irritating substances should not be given.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1043. <span class='smcap'>Nitre</span>&mdash;<i>Saltpetre.</i>&mdash;This, in over-doses, produces violent poisonous
symptoms. Vomiting should be immediately induced by large doses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
of mucilaginous, diluent drinks; but emetics which irritate the stomach
should not be given.</p>
<p class='box'><a name='TC_130'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">1035.</ins> What is the antidote? 1036. What should immediately be done when arsenic
is swallowed? 1037. What is the antidote? Can any quantity of this preparation of
iron be given without injurious results? 1038. What should be given when verdigris
has been taken into the stomach? 1039. What is the antidote? 1040. What should
immediately be given when sugar of lead is taken? 1041. What is the antidote?
1042. Give the treatment when corrosive sublimate has been swallowed. 1043. What
effect has an over-dose of saltpetre? What treatment should be adopted?</p>
<p class='topspace'>1044. <span class='smcap'>Zinc.</span>&mdash;Poisoning is sometimes caused by the <i>sulphate of zinc</i>,
(white vitriol.) When this takes place, vomiting should be induced, and
aided by large draughts of mucilaginous and diluent drinks. Use the
stomach-pump as soon as possible.</p>
<p>1045. The antidote is the <i>carbonate</i>, or <i>super-carbonate of soda</i>.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1046. <span class='smcap'>Nitric</span>, (aqua fortis,) <span class='smcaplc'>MURIATIC</span>, (MARINE ACID,) OR <span class='smcaplc'>SULPHURIC</span>
(OIL OF VITRIOL,) <span class='smcaplc'>ACIDS</span>, may be taken by accident, and produce poisonous
effects.</p>
<p>1047. The antidote is <i>calcined magnesia</i>, which should be freely administered,
to neutralize the acid and induce vomiting. When magnesia cannot
be obtained, the <i>carbonate of potash</i> (sal&aelig;ratus) may be given. <i>Chalk</i>,
powdered and given in solution, or strong <i>soap suds</i>, will answer a good
purpose, when the other articles are not at hand. It is of very great importance
that something be given speedily, to neutralize the acid. One of
the substances before mentioned should be taken freely, in diluent and
mucilaginous drinks, as gum-water, milk, flaxseed, or slippery-elm tea.
Emetics ought to be avoided.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1048. <span class='smcap'>Oxalic Acid.</span>&mdash;This acid resembles the sulphate of magnesia,
(epsom salts,) which renders it liable to be taken, by mistake, in poisonous
doses. Many accidents have occurred from this circumstance. They can
easily be distinguished by tasting a small quantity. <i>Epsom salts</i>, when
applied to the tongue, have a very bitter taste, while <i>oxalic acid</i> is intensely
sour.</p>
<p>1049. The antidote is <i>magnesia</i>, between which and the acid a chemical
action takes place, producing the oxalate of magnesia, which is inert.
When magnesia is not at hand, <i>chalk</i>, <i>lime</i>, or <i>carbonate of potash</i>, (sal&aelig;ratus,)
will answer as a substitute. Give the antidote in some of the mucilaginous
drinks before mentioned. No time should be lost in introducing
the stomach-pump as soon as a surgeon can be obtained.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1050. <span class='smcap'>Ley.</span>&mdash;The ley obtained by the leaching of ashes may be taken
by a child accidentally. The antidote is vinegar, or oil of any kind. The
vinegar neutralizes the alkali by uniting with it, forming the acetate of
potash. The oil unites with the alkali, and forms soap, which is less caustic
than the ley. Give, at the same time, large draughts of mucilaginous
drinks, as flaxseed tea, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='box'>1044. What is the antidote for white vitriol? 1047. What is the antidote for aqua
fortis and oil of vitriol? Should emetics be avoided? 1048. How can oxalic acid be
distinguished from epsom salts? 1049. What is the antidote for an over-dose of oxalic
acid? When magnesia cannot be obtained, what will answer as a <a name='TC_131'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Changed '.' to '?'">substitute?</ins>
1050. What is the antidote when ley is swallowed?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span></div>
<h3>VEGETABLE POISONS.</h3>
<p>1051. The vegetable poisons are quite as numerous, and many of them
equally as virulent, as any in the mineral kingdom. We shall describe the
most common, and which, therefore, are most liable to be taken.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1052. <span class='smcap'>Opium.</span>&mdash;This is the article most frequently resorted to by those
wishing to commit suicide, and, being used as a common medicine, is easily
obtained. From this cause, also, mistakes are very liable to be made, and
accidents result from it. Two of its preparations, <i>laudanum</i> and <i>paregoric</i>,
are frequently mistaken for each other; the former being given when the
latter is intended.</p>
<p>1053. <i>Morphia</i>, in solution, or <i>morphine</i>, as it is more commonly called
by the public, is a preparation of the drug under consideration, with which
many cases of poisoning are produced. It is the active narcotic principle
of the opium; and one grain is equal to six of this drug in its usual form.</p>
<p>1054. When an over-dose of opium, or any of its preparations, has been
swallowed, the stomach should be evacuated as speedily as possible. To
effect this, a teaspoonful of ground mustard seed, or as much tartar emetic as
can be held on a five cent piece, or as much <i>ipecacuanha</i> as can be held on a
twenty-five cent piece, should be mixed in a tumbler of warm water, and
one half given at once, and the remainder in twenty minutes, if the first has
not, in the mean time, operated. In the interval, copious draughts of warm
water, or warm sugar and water, should be drank.</p>
<p>1055. The use of the stomach-pump, in these cases, is of the greatest
importance, and should be resorted to without delay. After most of the
poison has been evacuated from the stomach, a strong infusion of <i>coffee</i>
ought to be given; or some one of the vegetable acids, such as <i>vinegar</i>,
or <i>lemon-juice</i>, should be administered.</p>
<p>1056. The patient should be kept in motion, and salutary effects will
often be produced by dashing a bucket of cold water on the head. <i>Artificial
respiration</i> ought to be established, and kept up for some time. If
the extremities are cold, apply warmth and friction to them. After the
poison has been evacuated from the stomach, stimulants, as warm wine and
water, or warm brandy and water, should be given, to keep up and sustain
vital action.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1057. <span class='smcap'>Stramonium</span>&mdash;<i>Thorn-Apple.</i>&mdash;This is one of the most active
narcotic poisons, and, when taken in over-doses, has, in numerous instances,
caused death.</p>
<p class='box'>1051. Are vegetable poisons as numerous and as virulent in their effects as mineral?
1052. What is said of opium and its preparations? 1054, 1055, 1056. What treatment
should be adopted when an over-dose of opium or any of its preparations is <a name='TC_132'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Changed '.' to '?'">taken?</ins>
1057. What is said of stramonium?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span></div>
<p>1058. <span class='smcap'>Hyosciamus</span>&mdash;<i>Henbane.</i>&mdash;This article, which is used as a medicine,
if taken in improper doses, acts as a virulent irritating and narcotic
poison.</p>
<p>1059. The treatment for the two above-mentioned articles is similar to
that of poisoning from over-doses of opium.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1060. <span class='smcap'>Conium</span>&mdash;<i>Hemlock.</i>&mdash;Hemlock, improperly called, by many, <i>cicuta</i>,
when taken in an over-dose, acts as a narcotic poison. It was by this
narcotic that the Athenians used to destroy the lives of individuals condemned
to death by their laws. Socrates is said to have been put to death
by this poison. When swallowed in over-doses, the treatment is similar
to that of opium, stramonium, and henbane, when over-doses are taken.</p>
<p class='topspace'>1061. <span class='smcap'>Belladonna</span>&mdash;<i>Deadly Nightshade.</i>&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Camphor.</span> <span class='smcap'>Aconite</span>&mdash;<i>Monkshood</i>,
<i>Wolfsbane.</i> <span class='smcap'>Bryonia</span>&mdash;<i>Bryony.</i> <span class='smcap'>Digitalis</span>&mdash;<i>Foxglove.</i>
<span class='smcap'>Dulcamara</span>&mdash;<i>Bittersweet.</i> <span class='smcap'>Gamboge.</span> <span class='smcap'>Lobelia</span>&mdash;<i>Indian Tobacco.</i>
<span class='smcap'>Sanguinaria</span>&mdash;<i>Bloodroot.</i> <span class='smcap'>Oil of Savin.</span> <span class='smcap'>Spigelia</span>&mdash;<i>Pinkroot.</i>
<span class='smcap'>Strychnine</span>&mdash;<i>Nux vomica.</i> <span class='smcap'>Tobacco.</span>&mdash;All of these, when taken in
over-doses, are poisons of greater or less activity. The treatment of
poisoning, by the use of any of these articles, is similar to that pursued
in over-doses of opium. (See <span class='smcap'>Opium</span>, page <a href='#page_442'>442</a>.)</p>
<p class='topspace'>1062. In <i>all</i> cases of poisoning, call a physician as soon as possible.</p>
<p class='box'>1058. Of henbane? 1059. What should be the treatment when an over-dose of
stramonium or henbane is taken? 1060. What name is sometimes improperly given to
<i>conium</i>, or hemlock? How was this narcotic poison used by the Athenians? How are
the effects of an over-dose counteracted? 1061. What is the treatment when an over-dose

tobacco, &amp;c., is taken? <a name='TC_133'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">1062.</ins> Should a physician be called in all cases when poison

<h3><a name='APPENDIX_A' id='APPENDIX_A'></a>A.</h3>
<p>The essential parts of every secretory apparatus are a simple membrane,
apparently textureless, named the <i>primary</i>, or <i>basement membrane</i>, certain
cells and blood-vessels. The serous and mucous membrane are examples.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_B' id='APPENDIX_B'></a>B.</h3>
<p>The division and description of the different membranes and tissues are
not well defined and settled by anatomical writers. This is not a material
defect, as a clear description of the different parts of the system can be
given by adopting the arrangement of almost any writer.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_C' id='APPENDIX_C'></a>C.</h3>
<p><span class='smcap'>Fat</span> is one of the non-nitrogenous substances. It forms the essential
part of the adipose tissue. Chemical analysis shows that all fatty substances
are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are lighter
than water, generally fluid at the natural temperature of the body, and burn
with a bright flame, forming water and carbonic acid.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Caseine</span> is abundantly found in milk. When dried, it constitutes <a name='TC_134'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">cheese.</ins>
Alcohol, acids, and the stomach of any of the mammalia coagulate it; and
it is also soluble in water. It is found in the blood, bile, saliva, and the

<p><span class='smcap'>Chondrine</span> is a variety of gelatin. It is obtained from cartilage. It
is soluble in warm water, but solidifies on cooling.</p>
<p><span class='smcap'>Lactic acid</span> is common to all the solids and fluids of the system. It is
found united with potash, soda, lime, or magnesia.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_D' id='APPENDIX_D'></a>D.</h3>
<p>The word <i>duodenum</i> is derived from the Latin, signifying &ldquo;twelve,&rdquo; since
the intestine, of which this is the name, is usually about twelve fingers&rsquo; breadth
in length. The <i>jejunum</i> is also from the Latin <i>jejunum</i>, empty, since it is
usually found in that condition after death, as the food seems to pass rapidly
through this part of the intestine. The term <i>ileum</i> is from the Greek, signifying
&ldquo;to twist,&rdquo; since it always appears in a contorted condition. The name
<i>c&aelig;cum</i> is derived from the fact of its being a blind or short sack, perforated
by the extremity of the ileum. The name of the next division of the intestine&mdash;<i>colon</i>&mdash;is
from the Greek, &ldquo;to prohibit,&rdquo; as the contents of the alimentary
canal pass slowly through this portion. The <i>rectum</i> is named from
the straight direction that it assumes in the latter part of its <a name='TC_135'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">course.</ins></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span></div>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_E' id='APPENDIX_E'></a>E.</h3>
<p>The food is forced through the alimentary canal by contractions of its
muscular coat, produced by the nervous filaments of the sympathetic system,
not being at all dependent on the cerebro-spinal centre. This is called
the peristaltic, or vermicular motion. The great length of intestine in <a name='TC_136'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'a'">all</ins>
animals, and especially in the herbivorous ones, is owing to the necessity of
exposing the food to a large number of the lacteals, that the nourishment may
all be taken from it.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_F' id='APPENDIX_F'></a>F.</h3>
<p>The different processes through which the food passes before assimilation
are of considerable interest. The mastication and mixture of the saliva
with the food are purely of a mechanical nature. When any solid or fluid
substance is placed upon the tongue, or in contact with the inner surface of
the cheeks, by an involuntary act, the salivary glands are stimulated to
activity, and commence pouring the saliva into the mouth through the salivary
ducts. As soon as mastication commences, the contraction of the
masseter and other muscles employed in mastication stimulates the salivary
glands to increased action, and a still greater quantity of saliva is secreted
and forced upon the food, which is constantly being ground to a finer condition,
until it is sufficiently reduced for deglutition.</p>
<p>Whether the salivary fluid acts any other part than simply that of a demulcent
to assist the gastric juice in still further dissolving the food, is yet a
matter of some doubt, although it is found that no other liquid will equally
well subserve the process of digestion and promote health.</p>
<p>After the food is in the condition ready to be swallowed, by an apparently
involuntary motion, it is placed upon the back of the tongue, which carries
it backwards to the top of the pharynx, where the constrictions of the
pharynx, aided by the muscles of the tongue and floor of the mouth, with a
sudden and violent movement thrust it beyond the epiglottis, in order to
allow the least necessary time to the closure of the glottis, after which, by
the compression of the &oelig;sophagus, it is forced into the stomach.</p>
<p>Here it is that the true business of digestion commences. For as soon as
any substance except water enters the stomach, this organ, with involuntary
movements, that seem almost like instinct, commences the secretion of the
gastric juice, and by long-continued contractions of its muscular coat, succeeds
in effecting a most perfect mixture of the food with this juice, by which
the contents of the stomach are reduced to the softest pulp.</p>
<p>The gastric juice, in its pure state, is a colorless, transparent fluid; &ldquo;inodorous,
a little saltish, and perceptibly acid. It possesses the property of
coagulating albumen, and separating the whey of milk from its curd, and
afterwards completely dissolving the curd. Its taste, when applied to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
tongue, is similar to that of mucilaginous water, slightly acidulated with
muriatic acid.&rdquo; The organs of its secretion are an immense number of
tubes or glands, of a diameter varying from one five hundredth to one three
hundredth of an inch, situated in the mucous coat of the stomach, and receiving
their blood from the gastric arteries. A chemical analysis shows it to
consist of water, mucilage, and the several free acids&mdash;muriatic, acetic,
lactic, and butyric, together with a peculiar organic matter called <i>pepsin</i>,
which acts after the manner of ferments between the temperature of 50&deg;
and 104&deg; F.</p>
<p>The true process of digestion is probably owing to the action of pepsin
and the acids, especially if the presence of the chloro-hydric or muriatic be
admitted; since we know, by experiments out of the body, that chlorine, one
of its elements, is a powerful solvent of all organic substances.</p>
<p>The antiseptic properties of the gastric juice, as discovered by experiments
made on Alexis St. Martin, doubtless have much influence on digestion,
although their true uses are probably not yet known.</p>
<p>As soon as the food is reduced to a state of fluidity, the pyloric orifice
of the stomach is unclosed, and it is thrust onwards through the alimentary
canal, receiving in the duodenum the secretions of the liver and pancreas,
after which it yields to the lacteals its nutrient portion, and the residuum is
expelled from the body.</p>
<p>There have been many hypotheses in regard to the nature of the digestive
process. Some have supposed that digestion is a mere mechanical process,
produced by the motion of the walls of the stomach; while others, in later
times, have considered it as under the influence of a spirit separate from the
individual, who took up his residence in the stomach and regulated the whole
affair; while others still would make it out to be a chemical operation, and
thus constitute the stomach a sort of laboratory. But to all these ridiculous
hypotheses Sir John Hunter has applied the following playful language:
&ldquo;Some will have it that the stomach is a mill; others that it is a
fermenting vat; and others that it is a stewpan; but in my view of the
matter, it is neither a mill, a fermenting vat, nor a stewpan, but a stomach,
<i>a stomach</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the present day this process is regarded as a complex, and not a simple
operation. It seems to be a process in which the mechanical, chemical, and
vital agencies must all act in harmony and order; for if one of these be
withdrawn, the function cannot be sustained for any considerable length of
time; and of the chemical and mechanical parts of the process, since the
former is much more important, and, as a matter of course, the vital powers
are indispensable, therefore digestion may be considered as a chemical
operation, directly dependent on the laws of vitality, or of life; since the
proper consistency of the food depends, in a great measure, upon the character
of the solvents, while the secretion of these fluids, their proper amount,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span>
together with the peculiar instinct&mdash;as it almost seems to be&mdash;necessary
to direct the stomach in its many functions, are exclusively and entirely dependent
on the laws and conditions of life.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_G' id='APPENDIX_G'></a>G.</h3>
<p>As food is necessary to supply the waste and promote the growth of the
body, it follows that that will be the best adapted to the system which contains
the same chemical elements of which the body is composed; viz.,
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. These elements are found in
greater or less quantity in all animal food, and in many vegetable products.
Hence, that article of food which contains all these elements in a proper
proportion will tend much more to the growth and strength of the body than
those kinds which are deficient in one or more of them. Much experience
on this point, and scientific research, seem to show that a reasonable amount
of animal food in health tends to give greater strength of muscle, and a
more general sense of fulness, than in ordinary cases a vegetable diet is able
to do, owing to the presence of nitrogen in animal tissues. Yet there are
examples of the healthiest and strongest men, who live years without a
morsel of animal food; and the fact can only be accounted for, by supposing
that the system has the power to make the most economical use of the little
nitrogen offered to it in the food; or else that it has by some means the
power to abstract it from the atmosphere, and transform it to the living animal
substance.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_H' id='APPENDIX_H'></a>H.</h3>
<p>The proximate principles, which are the most important in nourishing the
body, are albumen and fibrin. These constitute the greater part of all the
softer animal tissues, and are also found in certain classes of vegetables, such
as peas, beans, lentils, and many seeds. Hence, in many cases, a vegetable
diet, especially if embracing any of those articles, would be sufficient to
sustain life, even if no animal food should be eaten. But no animal can
exist for a long time if permitted only to eat substances destitute of nitrogen,
as in the case of a dog fed entirely on sugar, which lived but thirty days.
And owing to this fact, Baron Liebig proposes to call substances used for
food, containing nitrogen, &ldquo;elements of nutrition,&rdquo; and those containing an excess
of carbon, &ldquo;elements of respiration;&rdquo; since, according to his view, the
food is necessary to support the growth of the body by replacing the effete
and worn-out particles with new matter, and also to keep up the supply of
fuel, in order to promote a sufficient degree of heat in the system. Accordingly,
under the first division would be included all lean meats and vegetables,

<p>This definition of exhalants is from the theory of Haller and others. It
is now believed that the fluids exude through the thin coats of the blood
vessels. This process is called <i>exosmose</i>, and is the <i>exhalation</i> of old
physiologists.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_J' id='APPENDIX_J'></a>J.</h3>
<p>It is a well-established fact, in animal and vegetable physiology, that membranes
possess the property of allowing fluids and gases to pass through
them in either direction, and also to permit two fluids to pass in opposite
directions at the same time. This property is designated <i>endosmose</i> when a
fluid passes from without a body inward; and <i>exosmose</i> when the reverse
takes place. The first is called <i>imbibition</i>. One of the most striking instances
of this, in the human system, is shown in the lungs, where carbonic acid and
water pass out through the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes and
air-cells; and the oxygen of the air enters the blood through the same membrane.
By this process of imbibition, the oxygenation of the blood is much
more readily and faithfully accomplished; inasmuch, as by the immense
number of bronchial tubes and air-cells a larger quantity of blood is exposed
to a greater portion of air, than if the blood were directly laid open
to the atmosphere in a mass, or the air were immediately transmitted
through it.</p>
<p>Since the function of respiration is to free the system of superfluous
carbon and hydrogen, by union with the oxygen of the air, it follows that
the greater the amount of the products to be expelled, the larger the quantity
of oxygen will be required to effect this purpose, as we find to be the
case with those who consume large quantities of food.</p>
<p>The quantity of oxygen daily consumed through the lungs by an adult
is about 32.5 oz., and the carbon in the food 13.9 oz. But in order to convert
this whole amount of carbon into carbonic acid, which passes off through
the lungs and skin, 37 oz. of oxygen are required; the remaining 4.5 oz.
being absorbed by the skin. If the supply of food remain the same, while
the amount of oxygen in the inspired air is diminished, the superfluous carbon
will induce disease in the system, as is the case of those persons who
are limited in their supply of air of a proper quality or quantity, and, consequently,
have less appetite for food than those who are abundantly supplied
with air of the proper standard of health; and in children, who proportionally
consume more food than adults, and who are more active, thereby
causing a more rapid circulation of blood, and, consequently, the removal
of more superfluous particles of matter.</p>
<p>In children we notice the need of air, by their disposition to be much in the
open air, and often inspiring more deeply than is common in older <a name='TC_137'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added '.'">persons.</ins>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span>
Also, if the carbon of the food does not have a requisite supply of oxygen
from the air, or other sources, the body becomes emaciated, although nourishing
food may be used. And on the other hand, if there be a diminished supply
of food, but an abundance of atmospheric air, leanness and emaciation are
sure to follow; owing to the fact that if the oxygen has no waste carbon
from the body to unite with, it combines with the fat, and some other soft
portions of the body, which the Author of nature seems to have provided
for this very purpose; as is seen in the case of hibernating animals, who
enter their places of winter abode sleek and fat, but crawl out in the spring
not merely deprived of their fatty matter, but also with great diminution of
all the softer parts, which have given up their share of carbon to supply
animal heat. One important cause of emaciation in febrile diseases is the
greater rapidity of the pulse and respiration, which consume more carbon
than is afforded by the scanty supply of food that is taken, although profuse
perspiration, which almost always occurs in some stages of fevers, greatly
diminishes the full state of the body.</p>
<h3><a name='APPENDIX_K' id='APPENDIX_K'></a>K.</h3>
<p>The theory of Baron Liebig concerning the change which the blood
experiences in color, in its passage through the lungs, meets with the approbation
of many physiologists, although there are some important difficulties
in the way of fully receiving it. A chemical analysis of the blood shows it
to be composed of albumen and fibrin, together with some other substances,
in small proportions, and always perceptible traces of iron. He attributes
the change in color to the iron, as this substance enters into combination
with carbon and oxygen. For, as the blood passes through the trunks of
the larger vessels and capillaries, it receives the carbon from the tissues
which are continually transformed, and taking up the oxygen from the arterialized
blood, forms carbonic acid, which unites with the iron, forming proto-carbonate
of iron. This being of a gray color, he supposes it to be that
which, with the other impurities of the blood, gives the venous blood the dark
blue color. Then, as the blood comes in contact with the oxygen, as it is
returned and exposed to this element in the lungs, the carbonic acid leaves
the iron, which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than for carbonic acid, and
forms the scarlet red peroxide of iron, that gives the characteristic color to
the arterial blood. After this, as the blood is sent out through the smaller
arteries and capillaries, it again gathers carbon and other impurities from
the system, and becomes the dark, venous blood, thus completing the whole
change of color in the circulation.</p>

<h3><a name='APPENDIX_L' id='APPENDIX_L'></a>L.</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, different articles of food have been divided into
the azotized and non-azotized, or those which contain nitrogen as one of their
constituents, and those which are nearly destitute of it. Of these, according
to Liebig, the azotized portions are simply to supply the waste that is
continually going on in the body, and promote its growth in the early stages
of existence, or, in other words, the nutrient portion; while the sugar, starch,
&amp;c., are mainly of use in the respiratory organs. The correctness of this
view may be understood from the fact, that the inhabitants in the colder
regions of the earth consume a much larger quantity of oil and fat than
the residents of hotter climates; and also those dwelling in the temperate
zones can eat with greater impunity a larger quantity of fat meats in the
winter than in the summer, there being then so much more demand for animal
heat than in the summer.</p>

<h2>KEY TO ANATOMICAL OUTLINE PLATES.</h2>
<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.</h3>
</div>
<p><span class='smcap'>In</span> using these plates, we would suggest, that the pupil carefully examine
the illustrating cuts interspersed with the text, in connection with the
lesson to be recited. The similarity between these and the plates will
enable the pupil to recite, and the teacher to conduct his recitation, from
the latter.</p>
<p>Let a pupil show the situation of an organ, or part, on an anatomical
outline plate, and also give its structure; while other members of the class
note all omissions and misstatements. Another pupil may give the use of
that organ, and if necessary, others may give an extended explanation.
The third may explain the laws on which the health of the part depends,
while other members of the class supply what has been omitted. After
thus presenting the subject in the form Of topics, questions may be proposed
promiscuously, from each paragraph, and where examples occur in
the text, let other analogous ones be given.</p>
<p>If the physiology and hygiene of a given subject have not been studied,
confine the recitation to those parts only on which the pupil is prepared.
When practicable, the three departments should be united; but this can
only be done when the chapter on the hygiene has been learned, while
the physiology can be united with the anatomy, in all chapters upon
physiology.</p>

<p>Some anatomists reckon more than this number, others less, for
the reason that, at different periods of life, the number of pieces of
which one bone is formed, varies. <i>Example.</i> The breast-bone, in
infancy, has <i>eight</i> pieces; in youth, <i>three</i>; in old age, but <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>In the plates illustrating the muscular system, the names of such muscles are
given as are referred to in the paragraph &ldquo;Practical Explanation.&rdquo; These names need
not be committed to memory. If a pupil wishes to acquire a knowledge of the
general attachment of the muscles represented in the plates, he can do so by <i>comparing</i>
the muscular plate with that of the skeleton, (fig.&nbsp;28.)</p>

<p>It appears to be a fact, that no two important organs can be
called into intense action at the same time, without injury to both,
as well as to the general system. This arises from the circumstance
that an organ, when in functional action, attracts fluids (sanguineous
and nervous) from other organs of the system. Except in a few
instances of high health in youth, the power of the system is not
adequate to supply more than one organ in action with the appropriate
fluids at the same time.</p>

<p>The time required for the digestion of the different articles of food
might vary in other persons; and would probably vary in the same

<p>The urinary organs, as well as the intestinal canal, should be
frequently and regularly evacuated. Some most distressing and
frequently incurable complaints are caused by false customs and
false delicacy in this particular. Teachers should be particularly
careful, and regard this suggestion in reference to young pupils.</p>

<p>Dr. Elliotson, and some other writers On physiology, have detailed
cases of death from voluntary suspension of respiration. But these
